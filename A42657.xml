            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HERE Preſent unto thee a Reply to an Anſwer made to a Book of mine, by a man I know not; and it ſeems I am not known to him. For in it, he chargeth me not onely with error in judgment, which is incident to man, <hi>Humanum eſt erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re:</hi> But alſo imputes to me pravity of intention, both to King and Kingdom, which is <hi>Diabolicum,</hi> the Character of thoſe, whom Satan poſſeſſes, filling their hearts with ſuch corrupt affections. Now to manifeſt my innocency, and (at the beſt) the <hi>Doctors</hi> great miſtake in theſe accuſations, I know no better way, then that which <hi>Paul</hi> took, in a caſe of malitious accuſation before <hi>Feſtus,</hi> and King <hi>Agrippa, Acts 26. verſe 4.</hi> To lay open what my manner of carriage hath been, in this preſent National difference; all the irregularities whereof, on one ſide my <hi>Opponent</hi> layes throughout his Book to my charge. Thou maieſt therefore underſtand; That in theſe late unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtempers of our Church and Nation, I have been a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Studier of Peace, and an hearty mourner, not onely for the ſins, but the hard and irregular ſufferings of either partie. And have been conſcientiouſly tender of that duty, wherein,
<pb facs="tcp:43185:5"/>either by the Word of God, or the legal oaths of this Nation, I ſtood engaged to my Soveraign. Hence have I, both ſuffered for him, and with him. And in my ſympathie, I was pierc'd the deeper, becauſe I could not but look upon his ſufferings, as reflecting ſcandal on our Religion, and Nation. Neither knew I how to excuſe thoſe, whom I was bound in conſcience, in ſo great a degree, to love, and honour in their places (as wel as his Majeſtie;) that not to be able to clear them, was (I truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs) as <hi>Davids ſword in my bones.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 42.10.</note> This made me reſtleſs in my ſpirit, while there was any thing (within my ſphere) for me to do, whereby any, the leaſt, probability appeared to further accommodation. For I ſtood in dread of a prolonged Civil War, not onely becauſe it would hazzard the Honour, and Weal of King and Parliament, in whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and mutual ſafetie, was involved the Glory, Strength, and Liberty of this Nation; But alſo, becauſe I fore-ſaw what ſluces it would ſet wide open to all exceſs of riot. And the further the War proceeded, the more was I confirmed in my ſad prognoſticks of it; For it ſeemed evident, that though the pretences for War were ſpecious, <hi>viz.</hi> Truth, and Purity: Either of which, is more precious then Peace; yet unleſs, by ſome happie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, War were ſhortned, we were in great danger to be no ſmal loſers, both in Truth and Holyneſs. Hereupon I drew up a Treatiſe of accommodation, preſſing it with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by mutual condeſcention. Which ſo far had the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſome peaceable men of quality, that had not ſome croſs accidents prevented, it may be, it might have ſeen the light.</p>
               <p>While my thoughts were ſtill buſied about peace, we had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, where I lived, that the King, ſending from <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Parliament, for a Treaty for Accommodation; had by the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord General, a ſhort anſwer returned, with a Copie of the National Covenant encloſed in it. The Engliſh whereof was interpreted to be, that unleſs the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were taken, no accommodation could be expected; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I took a ſerious view of the Covenant, to ſee what was in it, that might cauſe unanſwerable ſcruple. The reſult of my thoughts was, that except the ſecond Article about Epiſcopacy,
<pb facs="tcp:43185:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>(mutatis mutandis,</hi> thoſe things being altered, that upon Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation muſt have admitted alteration) there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that might greatly ſcruple, a minde moderate and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And for that ſecond Article, conſidering the government of the Church by Biſhops, was never determined by our Church to be <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> And that we acknowledg, as Siſters, thoſe Churches that have admitted Presbytery; And ſith what is Humane, is, upon good and weighty motives, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; And what more weightie motive can be to induce a Prince, to conſent to alter what is alterable, then to preſerve three flouriſhing Churches and Kingdoms, from blood and aſhes? The onely difficulty, I apprehended, in reference to his Majeſty, in that Article (ſuppoſing him to be of the ſame judgement, with this moſt learned Father, touching Epiſcopacy, in his <hi>Baſilicon Doron</hi>) reſted in his oath at Coronation; which I had read urged ſtrongly, but modeſtly, in an <hi>Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> Book, written on the Royal ſide about this War; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preſt with more violence, in a Treatiſe againſt the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>On theſe Books, therefore I reſolved to make an aſſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what was objected in that particular, were ſolveable. And on this occaſion was the <hi>Caſe Reſolved</hi> firſt compiled. Which having finiſh'd, I communicated to one of the Kings Chaplains (as learned, rational, and ſincerely affected to his Majeſtie, as Doctor <hi>Boughen,</hi> though not ſo froward) who agreed with me in deſiring, and endeavouring accommodation. He preſented it to a Counſellor of State, (a lover of peace, and in good eſteem with his Majeſtie;) What uſe he made of it, I know not.

On this occaſion, after ſome moneths, if not years, it ſaw the light. And ſome Copies being given to the <hi>Scots</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
<pb facs="tcp:43185:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>they preſented one to the King, who read it, and (if my Intelligencer fail me not) though he received not ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it, yet his cenſure of it, did neither diſcover paſſion, nor contempt, but the contrary.</p>

<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.4.6, 7, 8.</note> and prove him to play <hi>Ziba</hi>'s, while I clear my ſelf from acting <hi>Shimei</hi>'s part. For firſt, whereas he ſaith, that <hi>'this Treatiſe aims at the ruine, both of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> This is moſt notoriouſly falſe; the ſcope of it being expreſſed in the very entrance of it, to be the preſervation of both, by Union and Accommodation. For want of which, how both have been hazzarded, is evident to every prudent obſerver of things. Again, for that he ſaith, <hi>That I tell the
<pb facs="tcp:43185:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>"King, that his Coronation-oath is a wicked oath,</hi> yea, affirm it to be, <hi>vinculum iniquitatis, the bond of iniquity:</hi> This is, in part, falſe, in part uncharitable, and crafty wreſting words, to draw blood out of them; For there is no ſuch expreſſion in all my Book, as that the Kings oath at Coronation, is a <hi>wicked oath.</hi> And though I uſe the tearm, <hi>vinculum iniquita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> yet by the expreſſions annexed, if he had ſet them down, there would have appeard no ſuch vileneſs in it, as he interprets it; the words are thus; <hi>[The bond of the Kings oath, may be taken off two wayes, either by clearing the unlawfulneſs of it, that it was</hi> vinculum iniquitatis, <hi>and ſo void the firſt day,</hi> &amp;c.] Now here the Reader may obſerve, that <hi>vinculum iniquitatis,</hi> was uſed by me, onely to note the unlawfulneſs of the oath in that particular; and its an uſual phraſe, to note the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs of the matter in any oath; yet I did not Engliſh it, becauſe it might ſeem harſher in our Language. Beſides, I did not aſſert, that the Kings oath was unlawful in that point, unleſs it did engage him to maintain Epiſcopacy, as then it ſtood, which the King hath declared it did not, in that he hath offered their regulation by Presbyters. How falſe then is the <hi>Doctor</hi> in this alſo, in poſitively affirming, that I make the kings oath, <hi>vinculum iniquitatis?</hi> When I do it, onely upon a ſuppoſition, which the king denies; yea, and which I did imagine the king might deny; and ſo declined that way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validating the bond of the kings oath, as appears plainly in my Treatiſe. But whether that argument that I brought, did prove it unlawful, to ſwear to maintain the Biſhops in the power they then executed, will appear, when I come to diſcover the ſillyneſs of the <hi>Doctors</hi> Anſwer. And if the oath be proved in that ſence unlawful, then I hope tits no offence, but neceſſary in diſpute, ſo to call it; unleſs we be to flatter Superiors in what ever they do; and ſo not honour, but Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize them, and lay ſnares for their feet.</p>
               <p>But <hi>with muſing on theſe, and other blaſphemies, fire was kindled in the</hi> Doctor. What were theſe other <hi>blaſphemies?</hi> Thoſe he names not, nor are we ever like to know. But that the <hi>fire was kindled,</hi> is evident by the fruits of it; but ſuch a fire, that I doubt not, but that the Reader will judge, that he
<pb facs="tcp:43185:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>might for it, more pertinently have cited <hi>James</hi> 3.6. then <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 39.4.</p>
               <p>After, to preſent me more odious, he cites a place out of Doctor <hi>Burgeſs</hi>'s <hi>fire of the Sanctuary, touching imprecations, and Seditious raylings againſt the Rulers of the people, and rude, bitter, unſeemly ſpeeches uttered againſt them.</hi> Alſo out of Maſter <hi>Wards</hi> Sermon before the Commons, about <hi>ſuffering vile men to blaſpheme, and ſpit in the face of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And affirms, <hi>all this</hi> Maſter <hi>Geree hath done undeſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Hath he uſed imprecations, or bitter railings againſt the Prince? Hath he uſed rude, bitter, unſeemly ſpeeches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Hath he blaſphemed, or ſpit in the face of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Convince all theſe, or any of theſe; and you ſhall finde him ready to repent, and ask God, and his Prince forgiveneſs. But if he hath not done all, no, nor any of theſe, then is Doctor <hi>Boughen</hi> a malicious Slanderer; and whoſe agent he is, in theſe accuſations, he may eaſily ſee, if he be pleaſed to view, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.10. But hath not Doctor <hi>Boughen</hi> in truth done that to the Parliament, which he falſely accuſeth me to have done againſt the Prince? And is not the Parliament an Aſſembly of Gods, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 82.1? And neereſt in honour and Authority to the king? Nay, hath not he done worſe to the king, then any thing that he laies to my charge? For is not perjurie worſe, then through incogitancie to ſwear to ſome thing that ſeems good, but is not lawful? (which is all that can be objected to me to have ſaid in reference to the King.) And doth not Doctor <hi>Boughen</hi> (while he ſaith, to aboliſh Epiſcopacie is no more againſt the kings oath, then to take away their Votes in the Houſe of Peers, <hi>pag.</hi> 87. and that he cannot conſent to aboliſh Epiſcopacy without perjurie, <hi>pag.</hi> 123. charge the king with perjurie, in conſenting to a Bill, for taking away the Biſhops priviledg, of Sitting and Voting in the Houſe of Peers? Then let him conſider, who is neerer <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and who hath more need to pray forgiveneſs in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. As touching <hi>Simon Magus;</hi> I am ſure I never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd money for any Eccleſiaſtical Gifts, nor Livings, and ſo am free from <hi>Simony.</hi> And to clear me from being a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,
<pb facs="tcp:43185:8"/>I Printed a Book againſt judicial <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> at the ſame time with the Treatiſe, which the Doctor would An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; which hath nettl'd <hi>Lily,</hi> and <hi>Booker,</hi> (no great friends to the king) neer as much, as my <hi>Caſe Reſolved,</hi> did Doctor <hi>Boughen.</hi>

The other is, <hi>The guides he wiſheth the Reader to "be led by in judging,</hi> viz. <hi>Reaſon, Scriptures and Authority.</hi> And therein, I fully cloſe with him, ſo far as Autority, the third, is guided by the two former, Scriptures and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And ſo far onely it deſerves reſpect.

               <p>VVHether the King, (conſidering his oath at Coronation to protect the clergy, and their priviledges) <hi>can ſalvâ conſcientiâ</hi> conſent to the abrogation of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? <hi>Aff.</hi>

               <p>When I conſider, firſt, that there is no hope of the Kings or kingdomes ſafety, without an union between our King and Parliament. Secondly, that ſuch an union is <hi>tantùm non impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> unleſs the King condeſcend in point of epiſcopacy: Thirdly; for the King to condeſcend <hi>renitente conſcientiâ,</hi> though it might gratifie us, it would be ſinful in him; and ſo he ſhould forfeit inward, to procure outward peace; and be repreſented to himſelf, in the glaſs of conſcience: to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the heavenly, to retain an earthly crown. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the oath taken at the Kings Coronation hath been preſt by ſome learned pens, with that probability, that may ſtumble a right intelligent Reader; neither have they, that I know, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any ſatisfactory anſwer in print. Now I conceive, it may be a work worth ſome paines, to reſolve this caſe, and cleer thoſe objections, that, while they ſtand unanſwered, caſt an ill reflection, both upon the King, in condeſcending to abrogate Epiſcopacy, and the Parliament, in preſſing him to it.</p>

Again, the grounds of undertaking the reſolution, are ſo weighty, and the candor towards Antagoniſts, in giving them due teſtimony, ſo cleer, that one would think it a fitter object for envy, then carping; but Dr. Boughen can finde a knot in a bulruſh; and therefore, becauſe in the title it is ſaid, that in the

And truly, as Prelacy ſtood with us in England, ingroſſing all ruledom in the Church, into the hands of a few L. Biſhops, I think, it may be cleared to be an uſurpation, by this one argument.</p>
            <p>That power that diſpoyls any of Chriſts Officers of any priviledg or duty indulged or injoyned them by the word of God; that power is an uſurpation againſt the word of God. But this did Prelacy, as it ſtood in England: therefore Engliſh Prelacy, was an uſurpation againſt the word of God.</p>
            <p>The Major is cleer of it ſelf. The Minor is thus proved: Presbyters are by Chriſts warrant, in Scripture, indued with power to rule in their own congregations, as well as preach; See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. &amp; 5,17, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12. Now as Prelacy ſtood in England, the Presbyters were not onely excluded from all ſociety of rule; but, which was more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the dignity and liberty of the miniſtery, were ſubjected to a lay-Chancellor; and was not here uſurpation againſt Gods direction?</p>
            <p>Now what ſaith Dr. <hi>Boughen? you ſay true</hi> (ſaith he)
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>that the oath which is Vinculum iniquitatis is void the first day, &amp;c. And hitherto your argument is good; and in it, he will joyniſſue, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Cap. 2. Parag. 1. See what a work
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43185:13"/>this paſſage hath on the Doctor, taken together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered when the blood was down; now all goes current; yet this is the place, for which he ſpit ſo much poyſon of aſpes in his Epiſtle to the Reader. I hope, the Reader will obſerve; and by appealing from the Doctor in paſſion, to the Doctor out of paſſion, ſee how injuriouſly he hath traduced me, for one that blaſphemes and ſpits in the face of authority. Well now, upon this <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>the Doctor will joyn iſſue, and will readily acknowledg, that if Prelacy in the Church be an uſurpation against Christs institution, then to maintain it, is to ſin, and all bonds to ſin are frustrate; but yet Parag</hi> 2.</q> 
               <hi>He adds, he hopes I uſe no tricks, but by Prelacy mean Epiſcopacy properly ſo called.</hi> Doctor, I do uſe no tricks, a good cauſe needs them not; but I doubt, you will be found to uſe tricks preſently, and that poor ones; that is, to change the ſtate of the queſtion: For when I implead Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy as unlawful, I implead it not abſolutely; but as it then ſtood in England. But the Doctor proceeds, and thinks that my <hi>medium</hi> is an arrow for his bow; and makes a triple aſſay to hit me with it, but is unlucky in all, as will preſently appear; firſt thus,

            <p>His ſecond Argument is againſt Ordination by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but in that he begs the queſtion, and therefore he refers us for the proof, (that Ordination by Presbyters is againſt Chriſts inſtitution) to another place, where we ſhall meet with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He argues,
<q rend="margQuotes">If Epiſcopacy in the Church be no uſurpation, but Chriſts inſtitution; then to endeavour the extirpation of it, is ſin. But Epiſcopacy is Chriſts inſtitution,</q>
               </hi>ergo. This he doth but propoſe here, and endeavours to prove hereafter, where his proofs ſhall be examined.</p>
            <p>He proceeds, parag. 3. <hi>"That you, your Aſſembly and Parliament, have made and taken an Oath to extirpate Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, is too notorious to be denyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, your are the confidenteſt man, not onely in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, but falſities, that I have heard. It's neither true, that I made the Covenant; nor notorious, that I have taken it: neither is it true, that the Covenant is to extirpate Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy; but onely, (according to my argument,) Prelacy, as it then ſtood, that is, by Arch-Biſhops, Arch-Deacons, and the reſt, in your &amp;c. Oath, as is plain by the expreſſion of the ſecond Article. And therefore you muſt prove, not onely (as you ſay) Epiſcopacy, but Epiſcopacy as it then ſtood, not to be contrary to the inſtitution of Chriſt, before you can prove the Covenant in that clauſe to be a bond of iniquity; or exempt the Kings oath from unlawfulneſs in that clauſe, if it binde to maintain Epiſcopacy as it then ſtood.</p>
            <p>But ſay you,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>The Order of Biſhops is Chriſts inſtitution. And yet ye have ſworn to up with it, root and branch.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The former you endeavour to prove; and the latter you take for granted, which is very falſe, for there is no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, nor hint, in the Covenant, as root and branch.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt you ſay,

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43185:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>theirs elſe where; and ſome of the Apoſtolical power was emulated in the Fathers times by Biſhops. But a Biſhop there properly he was not, for that were to degrade him: an Apoſtle being an office extraordinary, and ſo higher then the ordinary office of Biſhop. And ſuch degradation is not onely injurious. But if the reſolution of the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> Counſel be true, cited by <hi>Bilſon, pag.</hi> 280. <hi>To bring back a Biſhop to the degree of a Presbyter, is ſacriledg;</hi> Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to bring down an Apoſtle to the degree of any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officer (as a Biſhop is) cannot want guilt. <hi>"And for Apollos, if he were Biſhop of Corinth:</hi> I pray you, why did not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> write to him, when he blames them for not excommunicating the inceſtuous perſon? and blame him for that neglect of diſcipline, and enjoyn him to ſee it done, and not the Church? Or why doth he ſay, that the cenſure was inflicted by many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6.? if <hi>Apollos</hi> were their Biſhop, who alone had power of excommunication; If he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>under the title of Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. (which <hi>Calvin</hi> approves not;) yet is he called Apoſtle, in a large, not ſtrict ſenſe, as contradiſtinct to other Church-officers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. For <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> indeed he is called, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Phlliippians, Your Apoſtle;</hi> but that is moſt generally taken, as <hi>Walo Meſſalinus</hi> confeſſeth, by Greek and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Interpreters; to hint, not the name of a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officer, but a meſſenger from the Church to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as our laſt tranſlation takes it; and the words following, imply part of his meſſage; <hi>he that miniſtred to my wants.</hi> And though <hi>Walo Meſſalinus</hi> diſſents, yet he confeſſeth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition not to agree ſo well with propriety of ſpeech. But theſe (you ſay) are confeſſed to be <hi>Apoſtoli ab ipſis Apoſtolis ordinati.</hi> Firſt, this is falſe; for neither <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor <hi>Meſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſpeak of their Ordination. And the very phraſe, an Apoſtle ordained of Apoſtles, ſhews, that the title, Apoſtle, is taken improperly.</p>
            <p>But Parag. 5. you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Apostles they were at that time called, but afterwards the name Biſhop was ſetled on them. For this you cite Theodoret.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>Apoſtles properly and truly ſo called. And the name of Biſhop came appropriated to thoſe who were lately called Apoſtles.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this, Firſt, I obſerve you have given us a clear confeſſion out of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that Biſhops and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were all one, divers names of the ſame office.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe that <hi>Theodoret</hi> affirms, that being in his time called Biſhops, were formerly called Apoſtles, were not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>Thirdly, he gives us no proof, that thoſe that are now called Biſhops, were formerly called Apoſtles: and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture is not infallible; Nay, is it not apparently falſe, that the name of Biſhop came appropriated to thoſe that were lately called Apoſtles, (but were not ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, Apoſtles truly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? Continued. I ſay, by the Fathers, calling them Biſhops, alluſively. But though the name of Biſhop was given to Apoſtles, by the Fathers: It cannot be ſhewen, where thoſe that are now called Biſhops, were called Apoſtles, (as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſignifieth a Goſpel officer) by the Scripture.

            <p>The <hi>Doctors</hi> inference is obſervable,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Hence is it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>are called Biſhops and Apoſtles. Biſhops in the poſt-ſcripts of the Epiſtles which were written to them by</hi> S. Paul, <hi>but Apoſtles by</hi> Ignatius, Theodoret, <hi>and many others.</hi>
               </q> Whence plainly it appears, that the poſt ſcripts of the Epiſtles, were not Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> but ſome other, later then <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret:</hi> And ſo have no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43185:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>force to prove <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Parag. 6. You add, <hi>Biſhops then they were called,</hi> &amp;c. That is, They were ſo called by men, that ſpake of officers in the Scriptures, according to the ſtile of their own times, but in Scripture-ſence, they were a degree above Biſhops, Apoſtles, or Evangeliſts; and in that ſence ſpeaks <hi>Walo Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalinus,</hi> whoſe name you abuſe.</p>
            <p>Parag. 7. You argue,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>They that have the ſame name and office with the true Apoſtles, are of the ſame order with the true Apoſtles. But Biſhop</hi> Timothy, <hi>and Biſhop</hi> Titus, <hi>and Biſhop</hi> Epaphroditus, <hi>have the ſame name and office with the true Apoſtles.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This argument you ſeem to glory in, but with how little reaſon, the Reader ſhall ſee. For whereas you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Biſhop</hi> Timothy,</q> 
               <hi>and Biſhop</hi> Titus, <hi>and Biſhop</hi> Epaphroditus, <hi>had the ſame name and office with the Apoſtles:</hi> This is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe. Firſt, for the name, neither have <hi>Timothy,</hi> nor <hi>Titus,</hi> the name of Biſhop, or Apoſtle, given them by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and for other authors, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> that call them Apoſtles; you muſt remember <hi>Theodorets</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, of ſome that were <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now in this proper ſence, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were not called Apoſtles, but by way of alluſion: and to have the ſame name, and not in the ſame ſence, argues nothing. For your proof from <hi>Salmatius,</hi> for <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> being called Apoſtle, (beſides, that in giving ſuch a ſence of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.25. he differs from many others, whoſe opinion is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) he onely calls him an Apoſtle, alluſively, not properly: and as you fail in the proof of the ſame name, ſo fail you more, in proving they had the ſame office; for this you prove, onely from
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>one part of Apoſtolical power, Ordination, and Juriſdiction:</hi>
               </q> Which they had from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in particular places; whereas the Apoſtolical office had power immediately from Chriſt, for ſuch juriſdiction, all the world over, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. And whereas, the Apoſtle,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43185:17"/>makes Apoſtles and Evangeliſts diſtinct offices, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. and bids <hi>Timothy</hi> do the work of an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. The Apoſtle ſhews plainly, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was in that rank. And thence it's clear, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> had not the ſame office with Apoſtles, but were in an inferiour order of Evangeliſts. So your argument falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>For your cloſe, "<hi>that Biſhops, and onely Biſhops, ſucceed the Apoſtles in ordination and juriſdiction:</hi> It's true of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Biſhops; but for your Biſhops, we ſhall not believe it, till you better prove it.</p>
            <p>Parag. 8. You proceed,

                  <hi>Since then Apoſtleſhip and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, are one and the ſame office;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But I have, in part, ſhewed already, (and ſhall more fully hereafter) that Apoſtleſhip and Epiſcopacy are divers offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were Chriſt the ordainer of Epiſcopacy, as he is not, your inference is but a childiſh miſtake; for neither doth the Covenant ſpeak of root or branch, nor, if it did, would it follow, that Chriſt ſhould be rooted up; for there is a root, properly of Propagation, and a root metaphorical of Inſtitution, which is by appointment the original of a thing. Chriſt, if all were true that you ſay, is but a metaphoricall root, a root by Inſtitution, whoſe eradication cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, if Biſhops, root and branch, be pluckt up. If a man undertake to take away all the trees in an Orchard, root and branch, will it follow, he muſt root up the Maſter that planted it too? Nothing leſs; ſo, nor in this caſe.</p>

            <p>But Parag. 9. You think you put a ſhrewd quaery,

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43185:20"/>Church is committed to them, to wit, Presbyters; and what he ſaid of Biſhops, belongs alſo to Presbyters, Biſhops being only in ordination above them: Thus <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters then were not excluded from governing.

            <p>The next proof is for the Doctor, happily miſprinted, 1 Tim. 5.21. inſtead of verſe 17. which I believe the Doctor could not but ſuſpect; but he was loth to meddle with it: yet if he mean to replie, I muſt now minde him of it, 1 Tim. 5.17. It is thus written, Doctor; <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> Theſe, you will grant, were Presbyter-Biſhops; for to allow any other at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> would marr the market; and ſee, here is ruling diſtinct from teaching, aſcribed to Presbyterie.</p>

               </q> Good Doctor, am I to prove that Presbyters only are rulers, or that Biſhops are not the only rulers, as they were with us? If then, Presbyters be here meant, and they be rulers, the Holy Ghoſt aſcribes power of ruling to them, which is the queſtion; ſo now I have <hi>confitentem reum.</hi> And your <hi>ſimile, Parag.</hi> 11.

                  <hi>Theſis,</hi> 6. That in the extraordinary Officers, there were ſome gifts and acts peculiar to them, as ſuch; as to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles immediate calling, divine inſpiration, infallibility in doctrine, univerſal charge; and in the Evangeliſt, to be an aſſiſtant to an Apoſtle, not to be perpetually fixt to any place, but for the finiſhing ſome ſpecial work, as <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Creet, cap.</hi> 1.5. &amp; 3.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There were ſome qualities and actions, which though required in, and done by them, as extraordinary offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, in an extraordinary way, yet are of neceſſitie; and are, in an ordinarie way, perpetually to be continued in the Church of God; as abilities to teach and rule the Church; and the acts of teaching, praying, ordination of Miniſters, Church-cenſures, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Theſis,</hi> 7.

This alſo is clear; power and authoritie require a ſubject; divine power and authoritie, a ſubject of divine inſtitution: Now no other remains of thoſe of Gods inſtitution, but Paſtors and Teachers, which if they be not the ſame, Paſtor is the chief. The other, as temporary, are ceaſed; therefore Paſtors muſt be their ſucceſſors, in all this power: and in them muſt the commands for execution be kept, without ſpot, or unrebukable, untill the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14.

This is clear; for thoſe <hi>Elders</hi> that were here ordained,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43185:29"/>were officers of Chriſts giving. The Apoſtles would ordain no other: it had been ſacrilegious preſumption; but they were neither <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Evangeliſts; Ergo,</hi> if Chriſts, they muſt be under either <hi>Paſtors or Teachers</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43185:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>election, or for his priority in converſion and ordination, had a preheminence of honour above the reſt, for order-ſake; who had no new ordination, or none for a great while, but what he had from his fellow-Presbyters, who choſe him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him, without any further ado, So <hi>Hierom, ep.</hi> 85. <hi>ad Evagrium,</hi> which he confirms from <hi>Alexandria; For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Alexandriae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>At</hi> Alexandria, <hi>even to</hi> Heraclas, <hi>and</hi> Dionyſius, <hi>Biſhops; The Elders did always name one Biſhop, choſen out of themſelves, and by them placed</hi> in excelſiori gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du, <hi>in an higher degree of honour,</hi> (not office.)

This preheminency that one had above the reſt, was by Eccleſiaſtical cuſtom, not by Divine inſtitution: and advanc'd him onely to an higher degree, or dignity; not to another order, diſtinct from his fellow-Presbyters; ſo that, ſtill he muſt derive his ſucceſſion from the Presbyters, or Biſhops, that were to be ordained in every Church, and is to finde his place in the divine Catalogue of officers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. under aſtors, and not Evangeliſts, or Prophets. That this preheminence was not from any divine inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Eccleſiaſtical ordination, <hi>Jerom</hi> is expreſs: <hi>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops muſt know, that they are greater then Presbyters, rather by cuſtome, then Divine diſpoſition,</hi> Hieron. in Tit. So <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> ep. 19. <hi>Although, according to the words of honour, which the Churches uſe hath obtained, Epiſcopacy is greater then Presbytery,</hi> &amp;c. Yet: See bere, the precedencie of Biſhops, is an honour of words, and a fruit of uſe. And this may be further cleared, from what was firſt done in conferring this preheminence. It was but a bare act of the reſt of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as appears by the example brought by <hi>Hierom,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Alexandria. They choſe out of themſelves, and ſet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43185:30"/>him in an higher degree:</hi> This they did of themſelves, and by themſelves, without any Divine command, (Let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, if there be any;) yea, without any example, in any of the Churches in the Scripture, and they did it by themſelves, without the concurrence of other, and they could not ſet him in an higher order; Presbyters cannot make an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this may appear, from that little difference that was between ſuch a Biſhop and a Presbyter, in the fathers times. <hi>Chryſoſt. Theophylact, Hilary, on</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the reaſon, why the Apoſtle paſſeth from directions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Biſhops, to directions about Deacons, no mention being made of a Presbyter; Give anſwer; Firſt, <hi>Hilary,</hi> or, <hi>Ambroſe, Quia Epiſcopi &amp; Presbyteri una ordinatio eſt, uter<expan>

Becauſe, of an Elder and a Biſhop there is but one ordination, both are Presbyters, but a Biſhop is firſt.</hi> And <hi>Chyſoſtom, Becauſe, a Presbyter doth ſo little differ from a Biſhop</hi> to wit, <hi>in nothing but ordination,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>In nothing but election,</hi> ſaith <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact.</hi> Now, where the difference is ſo little, that one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for qualification will ſerve for both; there is plainly acknowledged a difference in dignity, or degree of excellencie onely, not in order or office.</p>
               <p>That conceit then of <hi>Theodorets,</hi> that they that are now called Biſhops, were heretofore called Apoſtles, and thoſe that are now called Presbyters, were then, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times, called Biſhops, is it ſelf too groundleſs a fancie for you (Doctor <hi>Boughen</hi>) to ground your diſtinction of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle-Biſhops, and Presbyter-Biſhops; as though our now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were Apoſtle-Biſhops, and ſo of an higher Order, and indued by that order from Jeſus Chriſt to many peculiar acts, which a Presbyter could not do: And that they are not only an higher degree of Presbyter-Biſhops, indued with power by humane wiſdome to proceed and order thoſe actions, which by divine right, belong to all their fellow-Presbyters, who are to joyn with them in theſe acts of juriſdictions: This diſtinction, I ſay of yours, it hath no bottom to bear it up.

               <p>For firſt, you ſee its directly contrary to <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> or <hi>Hilary,</hi> and many others; who make Biſhops in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43185:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>their times, to be the ſame with Presbyters, or Presbyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Biſhops, as you call them: Nay, it differs from other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who though they acknowledg not an <hi>Identity</hi> of a Biſhop and Presbyter; yet they take that, which you ſay is ſpoken of a Presbyter-Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. of ſuch Biſhops as were in their time, which you would have to be Apoſtle-Biſhops.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It hath no ground in Scripture. The Scriptures ſets no other orders, but Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, which are thoſe Presbyter-Biſhops, ſpoken of <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Now the three firſt are extraordinarie, and ceaſ'd; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only remain. And therefore the Biſhop, for what of him is divine, muſt be a Paſtor, and that's the ſame with a Presbyter-Biſhop; elſe, ſhew us ſome inſtitution for him: To talk of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> is vain, being it is witneſſed by Scripture, confeſ'd by all, that they were Evangeliſts, which is extraordinary: Succeſſors they may, and muſt, have in the work of ordination, but in their office they have not; but the ſame work is done by Paſtors, ſucceeding them in thoſe acts of Diſcipline, as well, as in thoſe of teaching and adminiſtring the Sacraments: Neither need we be moved with the appellation which the Fathers beſtow on them, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Biſhops of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Crete;</hi> and ſaying, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in them, taught all Biſhops. For when Scripture calls them Evangeliſts, and reckons Evangeliſts among ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie offices, that Chriſt hath given; what authoritie is of force againſt this teſtimony? Therefore we favourably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the ſaying of thoſe Fathers: that they call them Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, with relation to the cuſtome of their times, who call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Biſhops, that did thoſe acts that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did, not that they were properly ſo: For they were of an higher order, and did theſe acts as Evangeliſts: which their ſucceſſors are to do, as ordinarie Paſtors: Neither will their being Evangeliſts hinder the uſe of their examples, or the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts given to them: For the ſame acts done by whatſoever officer, are to be done by the ſame rule; and therefore, as directions given to them for preaching, ſo for acting in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43185:31"/>are to be followed by other ordinary Officers; upon whom (by their deceaſe) the power and care of their acts, are devolved, though of an inferior order: <hi>Timothy</hi> was to imitate <hi>Paul;</hi> an Evangeliſt, an Apoſtle: and every Paſtor is to imitate theſe Evangeliſts, in ſuch acts, as are common to Evangeliſts with them.</p>

                  <hi>Theſis,</hi> 13. All Presbyters being of the ſame Order, and that the higheſt of thoſe that are now in the Church, have by divine law, equal power in places where the Holy Ghoſt hath ſet them Paſtors and Biſhops, as to preach the word, and adminiſter Sacraments, ſo to do all other acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when called, requiſite for the edification and perſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church; and the Biſhop, who is but <hi>primus Presbyter,</hi> made by man for Orders ſake, can rightly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge no Monopoly, or ſole intereſt, but only a preſidencie, to guide, rule, and order that Presbyterie, wherein acts of juriſdiction are exerciſed, whether acts of ordination, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; binding, or looſing; excommunicating, or abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This I prove by theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument,</hi> 1. Thoſe who are truly and equally the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles, in ordinarie, and neceſſary acts of the Miniſtry; to thoſe by their office, belong all the acts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, that are neceſſary, and ordinary acts of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But Presbyter-Biſhops are ſuch ſucceſſors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear of it ſelf; the <hi>Minor</hi> I prove thus: Paſtors are truly, and equally ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, in neceſſary and ordinarie duties of the Miniſtry, as appears <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors.</p>
               <p>The three former were extraordinarie, temporary, and ceaſ'd; ſo the Paſtor muſt be the ſucceſſor, if they have any: But Presbyter-Biſhops ſet over the flock by the Holy Choſt, to feed it, are equally and truly Paſtors: <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is clear, from the definition of a Paſtor, which is an officer ſet over the flock of God, to feed it, <hi>&amp; definitio competit omni, &amp; eſſentia non variatur gradibus.</hi> See Acts 20.28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument,</hi> 2. Thoſe that by divine law are equall in the power of order, thoſe are equal in the power of government, or juriſdiction. All Presbyters, firſt and ſecond, are equall in power of order; <hi>ergo.</hi> For the <hi>Minor,</hi> that all Presbyters are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43185:32"/>equal in the power of order; it may appear by the definition of the power of order:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. of the Church, <hi>cap.</hi> 27</note> the power of order (ſaith <hi>Field</hi>) is that; whereby perſons are ſanctified, and inabled to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch ſacred acts, as other men, neither may, nor can do; as is the preaching of the Word, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>Now all Presbyters,
<note place="margin">See <hi>Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 39.</note> as <hi>Field</hi> confeſſeth, are equal in the power of Order; yea, not only he with other Proteſtants, but many School-men, and other Papiſts alſo, as he there ſhews: <hi>For every Prieſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Durand</hi>) <hi>in regard of his Prieſtly power, may miniſter all Sacraments; ea quae ſunt ordinum,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Aureolus</hi>) <hi>omnes recipiunt immediatè à Chriſto: ita quòd in poteſtate nullius, imò nec Papae eſt, illa auferre: in</hi> 4. <hi>ſent. Diſt.</hi> 24. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. Sect. <hi>tertia ratio</hi> &amp;c. And this alſo appears becauſe they muſt all ſit under the ſame title of Paſtors, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Major.</hi> I prove it thus. Power of juriſdiction is, indeed, but a branch of the power of Order. A man by the power of order, is made a Miniſter of Chriſt, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to ſerve Chriſt, in all miniſterial ſervices required of ſuch a Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now theſe ſervices are to edifie the Church, either by food, or phyſick; to further their ſalvation by word, or rod of Diſcipline: Now both theſe being miniſterial acts and orders, making a man a Miniſter: hence it follows, that they that are equall in orders, <hi>in actu primo,</hi> in regard of power, when they have a call, are equally inabled to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of diſcipline, or juriſdiction, as well as preaching, and conſecrating Sacraments, both being acts of that office, to which he is advanc'd by orders. And thus much <hi>Field</hi> doth, ina manner confeſs: <hi>Three things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are implyed in the calling of Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters. Firſt, An election, choice, or deſignment of perſons, fit for ſo high and excellent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Secondly, the conſecration of them, and giving them power and authority, to intermeddle with things that pertain to the ſervice of God; to perform eminent acts of gracious effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and admirable force, tending to the procuring of the eternal good of the ſons of men, and yield unto them whom Chriſt hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:43185:32"/>redeemed with his moſt precious blood, all the comfortable means, aſſurances, helps, that may ſet forward their eternal ſalvation. Thirdly, the aſſigning, and dividing out to each man, thus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to ſo excellent a work, that portion of Gods people, that he is to take care of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now here plainly, under aſſurances, means, and helps to ſet forward ſalvation, acts of Diſcipline muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5, 6. and this flows from power of order, as its habit is, <hi>actus primus,</hi> induing a man with power.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween acts of jurisdiction, &amp; other acts of order; the one every Presbyter may do alone; the other only in a Presbytery.

               <p>The ſame is plain of the Elders of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendent had no other charge from God, but only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencie of honour, and order, from themſelves: Beſides, all Presbyter-Biſhops ſet over charges by the Holy Ghoſt, are of thoſe Paſtors, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.

               <p>
                  <hi>Argument,</hi> 3. To whom the keys of the Kingdom of heaven are equally given; they have equall power of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: but to all Presbyter-Biſhops, the keys of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven are given, and equally given: <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear; for the keys of the Kingdom of heaven contain all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; that's without all queſtion. and the Apoſtles are hereby uſually proved to be equall in juriſdiction, becauſe the keys were equally given to them.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Minor;</hi> the keys are appendants to the office of the Miniſter. The Apoſtles with miſſion had the keys, <hi>John</hi> 20. and ſo the confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> agrees harmoniouſly with the reſt in this, <hi>that the power of the keys is equally in all Miniſters, Harmon. of conf. chap</hi> 18. <hi>p.</hi> 362. So at the ordination of a <hi>Presbyter; the key of Diſcipline was given to the Presbyter, as well as that of Doctrine, in the Church of</hi> England. And if there be an equalitie in that order, whereof the keys are an appendix, they muſt have the appendix following in equality likewiſe, that are equal in that order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument,</hi> 4. That to which a man hath right, and, in acting, is reſtrained only by cuſtom, novell conſtitutions or Eccleſiaſticall Canons, that, by Gods law, he hath equal right to with others. But Presbyter-Biſhops are reſtrained from, or limited in acts of government, (to which they have right) only by cuſtome, novell conſtitutions of Emperours, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Canons: <hi>ergo, Jure Divino,</hi> power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in them equally with others.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> that they have power of government, I have formerly proved, becauſe it is an act of their office: for the exerciſe of it, ſometimes in ordination, <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and for government, <hi>Jerome</hi> gives clear teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie: <hi>Eccleſiae olim communi Pres by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But I ſay, firſt, the moſt ancient, (as is to be ſeen in <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell</hi>)
<note n="*" place="margin">Apol. pro ſententia Hieron.</note> ſpeak but of two orders of Goſpel-Officers in their time, which they ſometimes call <hi>Biſhops and Deacons;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Presbyters and Deacons: Only <hi>Ignatius</hi> is urged, as a great friend of Biſhops; but indeed he is too great a friend, for he doth ſo far exceed in his expreſſions, and ſo differ in that, from other writers of his time; that for that, and many other things, all, or the greateſt part of his Epi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the moſt rationall of the Fathers, as <hi>Hierome,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> have witneſſed, (not ſpeaking <hi>obiter,</hi> or <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi> but <hi>purpoſely,</hi> giving their judgment in the thing,) that the difference between Biſhop and Presbyter, is the iſſue of cuſtome and uſe, not divine inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally, give the Biſhop but a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency,</hi> not a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> in juriſdiction: They aſcribe to him a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> in which, and with which, he was to ordain, and cenſure; and without which, he was not to act in theſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43185:34"/>things. And this plainly enough ſhews, that the Biſhops Preſidencie was but for order ſake, not that power reſted only in him; for that power that is reſtrained by Divine ordinance to one order, may not be interpoſed in by another;

               <p>Fourthly, the Fathers differ more from the high Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, then from the Presbyterian: For the Presbyterian al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies have a Preſident to guide their actions, which they acknowledg may be perpetuall, <hi>durante vitâ modò ſe bene geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerit;</hi> or <hi>temporary,</hi> to avoid inconvenience, which <hi>Bilſon</hi> in his preface, (and again, and again, in his book of <hi>perp. gover.</hi>) takes hold of, as advantageous, becauſe ſo little diſcrepant, (as he ſaith) from what he maintains: but now the high Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts exclude a Presbyterie, as having nothing to do with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, which they put as far above the ſphear of a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, as ſacrificing above a Levites; to wit, an act reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an higher order: whereas the Fathers acknowledg a Presbyterie; and in divers caſes, Counſels tye the Biſhop to do nothing without them; and ſo its clear, the high Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts are at a further diſtance from the Fathers, then the Presbyterians.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, for that, wherein we differ from the Fathers, we have the Plea of one of the moſt judicious of the Fathers, <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who being preſt with the authoritie of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> anſwers <hi>lib. contra Creſſcon.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>His writings I hold not as Canonicall, but examine them by the Canonicall writings: And in them, what agreeth with the authority of Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I accept with his praiſe; what agreeth not, I refuſe with his leave.</hi> This is our apologie, in diſſenting in this thing

               <p>Laſtly, if we differ from the Fathers in point of Prelacie, (wherein our opponents are in no better terms with them, then we;) yet I would have them to conſider, in how many things we jump with the Fathers, wherein many of them have been diſſenting, both in opinion, and practice; as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promiſcuous dancing, eſpecially on the Lords day. 2. Touching reſidency of Paſtors in their Churches, which excludes alſo pluralities. 3. Frequencie and diligence in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. 4.

               <p>And thus; (Doctor) I ſhall leave it to the judgment of the indifferent reader, whether Apoſtle-Biſhops be not a meer fancy of your own framing; and indeed, now, there be no other but Presbyter-Biſhops; one of which for Eccleſiaſtical cuſtome, for pious ends had ſome power added to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency, for order, which afterwards degenerated into ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.</p>

               <head>The Caſe Reſolved.</head>
               <p>THe uſual way of clearing this aſſertion, is thus: The King is ſworn to maintain the laws of the Land in force, at his Coronation; yet no man queſtions, and the conſtant practice ſhews, that it is not unlawful after, to abrogate any, upon the motion, or with the conſent of his Parliament: The meaning of the oath, being known to be, to maintain the laws, while they are laws: but when they are abrogated by a juſt power, in a regular way, they are then wiped out of his charge and oath. So the King by his oath, is bound to maintain the rights of his Clergie, while they continue ſuch. But if any of their rights be abrogated, by juſt power, he ſtands no longer engag'd to that particular.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive, to be a ſound reſolution: For the Kings oath is againſt acting, or ſuffering a tyrannous invaſion on laws and rights, not againſt a Parliamentarie alteration of either. But here ſteps in my firſt opponent, and though he diſputes modeſtly, onely propoſing, what he holds forth,
<note place="margin">A nameleſs Author in a Book, implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King</note> to ſerious conſideration; yet he objects ſubtilly, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe runs thus. <hi>The oath for maintenance of laws, is made</hi> Populo Anglicano, <hi>to the people of</hi> England, <hi>and ſo may be taken off by a future act, becauſe it is by their own conſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Parliament. But the oath to maintain the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Clergie, is made to ſuch a part of his people,</hi> Clero Anglicano, <hi>and particularly taken by him, after his oath to the whole Realm, which were needleſs, unleſs it meant ſome other obligation. This ſeems</hi> (ſaith the learned Author) <hi>to

               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, taking it for granted, that the oath is thus taken by the King; That oath was ſo framed, when <hi>Clerus Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> was a diſtinct Societie or Corporation, (as I may ſo ſay) <hi>à populo Anglicano,</hi> from the people of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>For what you ſay, <hi>parag.</hi> 14. of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> I formerly proved them to be Evangeliſts, and what they had extraordinarie, to be ceaſ'd; what they have ordinary, to reſt in Paſtors, who are Presbyter-Biſhops, the higheſt ordinarie Officers.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43185:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>as upon ſearch I finde, onely of that Biſhop, as he then ſtood <hi>Orthodox,</hi> in oppoſition to ſome curſed weeds, or <hi>Hereticks</hi> of the devils planting; but when the Biſhop was an <hi>Heretick,</hi> as you know in many places it often fell out, would they have been <hi>bleſſed</hi> or <hi>curſed,</hi> that held with the Biſhop, think you?</p>
               <p>For what you add, "<hi>touching the privileges of Clergy;</hi> For the moſt part, you falſly calumniate me, that I ſeek to ruine them; you know, I call the alieanation of their means Sacriledg; neither do I envie any of their juſt priviledges; but this is that which I have in hand; whereas there be two ſorts of priviledges, ſome Divine, ſome humane, I queſtion onely whether thoſe humane priviledges, ſeparable from the offices appointed by Chriſt in his word, ſuch as the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of one above all other, may not upon adviſement, for the good of the Republique, admit of alteration, as well as Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges?

            <p>But may there not be the Counſell and advice of Divines, to a Parliament, in matters of God, unleſs they ſit and vote with Peers, in matters ſecular?

            <p>The diſtinction is good, and helps to clear what I intend; that the King may alter the Prelacie in queſtion, which is but the gift of Princes, not God. See the erudition of a Chriſtian man, on the Sacrament of orders. And Princes may revoke their own grants: but

               <p>AGain when this oath was framed, the Church was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, by the ignorance of the times, with divers unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful immunities; in all which reſpects the oath was invalid, being <hi>vinculum iniquitatis;</hi> and ſome were pared off, as light ſhined forth. And why may not the great revenues of the Biſhops, with their ſole juriſdiction, in ſo large a circuit, be indicted and convict to be againſt the edification of the Church, and it be found more for the glory of God, that both the revenue be divided to maintain a preaching Miniſterie; and their juriſdiction alſo, for the better over-ſight and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of manners? And then is there as good a plea, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oath, to alter this uſeleſs anti-Evangelical pompe, and domination of a few; as to antiquate, other immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ariſing from the error of the times, not the tenure of Scripture.

If their immunity be not by law, it is either an uſurpation without juſt title, which upon diſcovery, is null: Or, it was given by Papall power in times of darkneſs, which being an Anti-chriſtian uſurpation, is long ſince aboliſht in this kingdom.</p>

            <p>If any think themſelves abſolv'd from the oath of allieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, by an ordinance, let them bear their burthen; neither do I go about to abſolve the King from his oath of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (as you here calumniate me) but interpret the bond ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, which you cannot anſwer; and ſo vent your ſelf in impertinent accuſations.</p>

<q rend="margQuotes">

            <p n="2">2. I acknowledg them your rights, that is, ſuch as you have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:43185:46"/>a legal claim to, while the laws thus ſtand; but theſe your rights were of three ſorts: 1. Some of your Canonicall priviledges (at leaſt formerly) were corrupt. Such were aboliſh'd by <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. Theſe were your rights, that is, you had claim to them by mans, not Gods law. 2. Some were eſſentiall to the callings, grounded on the Word of God. 3. Some were indulged by the Prince and State. The firſt ſort were void to a Chriſtian, by their anomie. The ſecond unviolable, by the unqueſtionable authoritie of God, the Author of them. The third are under the Conſult of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, as other laws, which are the peoples birth-right, and they may alter both, if they ſee occaſion: So the laws that concern the Clergie, make them neither worſe nor better, then thoſe laws that concern the Laytie, render them.</p>
            <div type="resolution">
               <head>Caſe of Conſcience Reſolved.</head>
               <p>THe Author illuſtrateth the force of his argument, by an example, holding forth an inconvenience: Where pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique faith is given for money, it is not releaſeable by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without conſent of the partie; for if it be, it is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, no ingagement, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There's a great deal of difference between an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement made to perſons on valuable conſiderations; and that which is made <hi>gratis</hi> to an office, or ſocietie, ſubſervient to publique good: Of the former kinde, is the engagement to pay ſums of money, of whom they were borrowed for publike good, which is indiſpenſible without the conſent of the lender. Of the latter ſort is this engagement to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Clergie. Now engagements to a Societie, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their rights, indulged for the perſonall worth of preſent incumbents; or to promote the uſefulneſs of that office: If in their matter they prove prejudiciall to the office; or the ſucceeding officers, by their ill demeanor, forfeit them, their engagement becomes alterable: There is no injuſtice done to make a law to over-rule, or alter this engagement. There's no queſtion of power in the Parliament, to over-rule it; for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43185:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the former caſe of money, if the King and Parliament ſhould ordain releaſe of the engagement, the engagement was gone in law, not in equitie the order would be <hi>valid</hi> in law though injurious: So, if there be no injurie, the King and Parliament may cancel any obligation. And where there is forfeiture by miſcarriage, or the priviledg to a Miniſtrie (which ought to hold nothing but for publike good) proves prejudiciall, the abrogation will be juſt, as well as legall, there will be no injurie done.</p>
               <p>But take it at the worſt, it is but for the King to get the Clergies conſent; and I hope in this caſe, they will not be ſo tenacious of their wealth and honour, as to let the Crown run an hazzard, rather then they lay down their Mitres, and indanger the whole land to be brought to nothing, rather then themſelves to moderation. I cannot but have a better conceit of the Major part of them, at this time, which will amount to a conſent, and that, in this Authors judgment, takes off the ſcruple about the oath.</p>

            <p>That which I have ſpoken of forfeitures, belongs to the

'<hi>We grant to God, and confirm the Church of</hi> England <hi>free,</hi> &amp;c.

Yet <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror did ill, to appropriate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands for covetouſneſs, and for it might miſcarry; ſo did they for the ſame cauſe, rob the Temples of the Heathen Deities; whence the proverbe, <hi>Aurum Toloſanum, in Aulus Gel.

                  <hi>that in ſtrictneſs of Reformation, Epiſcopacy was continued in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>as moſt uſeful for the Church.</hi>
               </q> How this obſervation is connected, I know not: It is a ſuddain motion; I may alſo juſtly take occaſion to give notice, that our Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath been counted defective, for keeping up Epiſcopacy in its height; and not either aboliſhing it, or at leſt bringing it within the ancient limits with a Presbytery; (which now is offered by the King.) And what other reformed Churches can the Author name, but it was part of their Reformation, to take away Dioceſan Epiſcopacy?</p>
            <p>Parag. 15. You expreſs a needleſs grief, to hear from a Preacher of the Word,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>that the Biſhops muſt lay down wealth, honour, and Mytres, or elſe the Crown muſt run an hazzard.</hi>
               </q> Are you ſorrie to hear a Preacher ſpeak the truth? hath not the Crown run an hazzard in this reſpect, as well as others? But whereas you ſay,

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43185:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>it. For that you add, that few of the Biſhops have gained ſo much by the Church as their breeding coſt their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; It will be credible but to a few, except to thoſe that know at what rates they made friends in the Court, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them.</p>

                  <hi>I might have done well to have directed this paſſage to the Parliament.</hi>
               </q> Truly you ſay true, and thoſe that know me, know I have not been backward, to preſs, and perſwade a condeſcenſion on their parts, as well as on the Kings; and that in writing too: which on as good an occaſion, as I had to print my Caſe, may ſee the light. But the Biſhops have not been ſo innocent, as you make them; for ſchiſm, they did not prevent it, but partly made it, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out both Miniſters and people for their own inventions, that willingly, and peaceably, would have held communion in all Gods ordinances; partly occaſion'd it by neglect of good Diſcipline, and rigorouſly requiring conformitie to humane ceremonies: for Hereſies, they did foſter them. How did the moſt of them connive at Papiſts? advance Arminians and Socinians, while they pretended againſt Socinianiſm? Blaſphemie in one kinde they hinder'd not, in that they let blaſpemous ſwearers paſs without diſcipline, and enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Sacraments. Atheiſm they promoted, by hindring the preaching of the Goſpel, which they were enemies to, for the moſt part, to uphold their dumb Miniſterie, and for fear their idleneſs ſhould be cenſured. They taught rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord, in teaching men to prophane his Sabboths: They hindred not, but occaſioned blood-ſhed, in oppreſſing <hi>Scotland</hi> with illegal impoſitions, ſtirring up the King to war againſt them, and to break his Pacification with them, which was the egg that hath bred this cockatrice that is like to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all.</p>
            <p>This I ſpeak not of all, but ſome of them; nor out of a delight I have to rake in other mens ſores; but to ſhew you, that Biſhops grew not into ſuch <hi>odium</hi> among the people for nothing; nor were they without miſcarriages, that occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuch a violence againſt them; and yet for my part, I grieve, that the peoples diſlike of them had not acted in a

               <hi>unleſs he were to provide for the Presbyters of his Church?</hi> For very good purpoſe: as the Apoſtle ſhews you himſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Theſe things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and teach.</hi> He was to teach it, others to perform it; for though he ſet Presbyters on work, in ſome ſenſe, yet it was not for himſelf, but Chriſt and his Church; and they who reap'd their <hi>ſpirituals, were to pay them temporals,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. And you dream, when you talk <hi>of Timothyes table, or allowing maintenance.</hi> Alas, he had no Palace then, he kept no Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like table to feed his Presbyters; theſe fancies will be ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to learned men, eſpecially to Biſhops, to lay the charge on them, to maintain all the Presbyters in their Dioceſs.

<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Whence the want of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for preaching Presbyters ariſeth, and you anſwer, it is from the appropriation of tythes, at the diſſolution of Abbeys.</hi>
               </q> This is true in part, but not in the whole; for I believe, the greater part of Appropriations are held of Biſhops, and Deans and Chapters; and if the Biſhops be to maintain the Presbyters, and withhold the tythes, who is the thief now? At leaſt, thus far, the attempt is juſt to reſtore their impropira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And I muſt tell you this too; That there was ſcarce any Gentleman of any ingenuitie or affection to religion, but he made a far more conſiderable addition, out of his impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:43185:53"/>to the incumbent, then either Biſhops, or Deans and Chapters; Though the one purchaſed them, when the other ſwore they came into them freely: Nay, ſome Gentlemen reſigned their impropriations freely: I can hear of no Biſhop that hath done ſo; though you ſay,

<q rend="margQuotes">

            <p>I anſwer not what you ſay; but ſo that wealth, which of late, ſerved for the uſeleſs pomp of one only Princely Lord Biſhop, would provide many able preachers for the uſe and edification of the Church.</p>
            <p>But you proceed, and ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>that the power of Biſhops, which were the main impediments to ſchiſm and hereſie, we

But this is but a falſe ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of yours; for though the power of Epiſcopacie (as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> ſaith) was firſt erected to prevent ſchiſm; yet amongſt us of late, as I have ſhewed, it was the great occaſion of ſchiſm, &amp; the fautor of divers hereſies. That there have of late appeared more hereſies and ſchiſm among us then formerly, is not becauſe Epiſcopacie was pul d down, but becauſe we were ſo long without Presbyterie ſetled, which is yet but lamely done; for where that is ſetled, it would far better prevent the riſe and growth of hereſie, then Epiſcopacie; as King <hi>James</hi> demonſtrated to <hi>Mountague,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> demanding of him, upon the occaſion of <hi>Legatts</hi> Arrianiſm, what the reaſon ſhould be, that <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſo free from ſchiſm and hereſie, when <hi>England</hi> was far more peſtered with both.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43185:54"/>touching manners; but alſo to try doctrine it ſelf: Here do propheſie at leaſt two; whereof the firſt doth only open the text and expound it: The ſecond doth give the uſe, exhortation, and application: This finiſht, the reſt meet together, and the two ſpeakers go aſide, untill the Moderator of the Presbyterie asketh every ones opinion of the doctrine delivered. And if (to ſay no worſe) they do but ſmell out any thing, either its forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with buryed by common ſuffrage, or if the Presbytery be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any queſtion, yet at least, the whole matter is huſht in ſilence untill the next Synod, which come twice a yeer.

               <hi>The Moderator of the precedent Synod begins with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and then, either a new Moderator is choſen, or (which ſeldom falls out) the old is continued.

<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Its true, and not true, that by Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Paſtors, the work of the Miniſtery is chiefly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>

'<hi>Nor are the ordering of the Church, or ordaining of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> without the ſphear of Presbyters, by any law of God, but humane cuſtom: No, nor are theſe the <hi>chief works of the Miniſtery;</hi> No Doctor: Preaching, and ſound Doctrine are the chief acts of the Miniſtery, which deſerve moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. and therefore, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up Miniſters, and their Miniſterial acts, governing comes behinde teaching, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Parag.</hi> 14. You think to prove, <hi>'That your Biſhops do the chief work, virtually, from an axiom in philoſophy, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quod aliquid eſt tale, illud ipſum eſt magis tale.</hi> But herein you ſhew your ſelf as bad a Philoſopher, as Divine; for doth <hi>propter quod,</hi> note out an efficient cauſe, or the final cauſe, think you? You are therefore miſtaken in your axiom, which is falſe, being as if you had ſaid, Presbyters are made Preachers, <hi>propter populum,</hi> for the people: <hi>ergo.</hi> the people are more Preachers: A wiſe concluſion. We have a rule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>quicquid efficit tale, eſt mag is tale.</hi> And I will grant, that they that ordain Preachers, ought to be more Preachers themſelves; but that, you know, is falſe in experience, in moſt of your Biſhops; therefore you ſhould know, that ſuch Axioms, are true onely in <hi>natural,</hi> not in <hi>voluntary</hi> cauſes, as the Logicians will teach you. Neither are the Biſhops the total cauſes of Preachers: Alas, at the moſt, they give them but Commiſſion to uſe their gifts authoritatively, which gifts they have from God, and are the fundamental cauſe to make them Preachers. Nor can Biſhops alone ordain Presbyters; that I have proved before. And what if I ſhould prove it now by an axiom of philoſophie? <hi>Generare ſibi ſimile, To beget his like, is the affection of a living creature;</hi> And Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, you know, is a living office, <hi>ergo,</hi> Presbyters may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Presbyters. I believe, you will ſweat to give a rational
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:43185:55"/>anſwer to it. What you add about <hi>ordinary Courts of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and Parliament;</hi> Sir, though I count the Parliament the ſupream Court, yet juſtice is chiefly done by inferiour Courts, becauſe it ordinarily lies on them, and the Parliament is onely to ſupply and rectifie their errors.</p>
            <p>But you proceed, and <hi>Parag.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Compare the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>to ſouldiers in an Army, and to Mariners in a Navy, and your Biſhops are as the General, they are as the Admiral.</hi>
               </q> So then, the people are no part of the Ship or Army, or elſe you level the Presbyters with the people, whom the Holy Ghoſt calls their guids ſet over them: Such ſimilitudes you uſe to make. <hi>But every Preacher is not fit to be a Biſhop:</hi> thats your judgement; but the Holy Ghoſt ſaith <hi>none ſhould preach, except he be ſent,</hi> and none ſhould be ſent, but ſuch as are fitted to take the care and over ſight of the Church, and thats the Holy Ghoſt's Biſhop: Whatever your opinion is, ſee 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Indeed, ſuch a Biſhop as you would have, Monarchically to govern a whol Dioceſs of a Shier or two, cannot be made <hi>ex quolibet ligno;</hi> but neither Scriptures, nor primitive times acknowledg any ſuch Biſhop; But ſuch a Biſhop as may joyn with others in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Church: a meaner man may be without prejudice, for others maturitie in judgement, may help his want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>What you object, <hi>Parag.</hi> 17. <hi>about the Levellers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſutable to this;</hi> Is but a capritious fancie of your own; for God hath comprized all ordinarie Miniſters under the ſame name of Paſtors; and therefore man can make no difference among them, but for orders ſake. Neither do I go about to level all Benefices: you know there is a difference, in a great diſproportion, which may be for men of different parts.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Parag.</hi> 18. You <hi>exclaim, becauſe I ſay,</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>there will be no danger of ſacriledg in my way.</hi> And firſt, you ſay, <hi>to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Epiſcopacy,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>is to overthrow the Church,</hi> and for that its not enough for you to abuſe a Father, but an Apoſtle too; for when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>we are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. Whats that, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:43185:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>but Jeſus Chriſt? So the Apoſtle, who is the beſt interpreter of himſelf, explicates it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. and adds, <hi>Planè eſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Chriſtus, quî ſibi tribnit quod unius Chriſti eſt: He is plainly anti-Chriſt, that arrogates to himſelf</hi> (or to any other) <hi>what is onely Chriſts.</hi> What think you of this? Again, thoſe that take the Apoſtles to be the foundation, is it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their perſons, authoritie, or doctrine? Their doctrine, I believe Sir; and will you compare your Biſhops, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to the Apoſtles and Prophets: Who, as ſuch, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; Nay, do you not confeſs the doctrinal part of the Miniſterie to belong to the Presbyter, as well as your Prelate, and to be more performed by them? and have you not made a fine proof of the fall of the Church with Biſhops, out of this place?</p>
            <p>But you add, <hi>Parag.</hi> 19. <hi>What, no danger of ſacriledg in robbing Father and Mother?</hi> But you anſwer for me, that it is no ſacriledg, becauſe the means ſhall ſtil be ſetled on the Church: and thats a reaſon which you cannot anſwer: For ſacriledg is an alienating of that which was juſtly devoted for ſacred, to civil, or prophane uſe; therefore change, ſo there be a continuance of holy uſe, is no ſacriledg: Nor ſhall we rob our Father; for, as you confeſs, holy treaſure was firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church in general: The Biſhops had not propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, but uſe of ſome, and with the reſt they were to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Presbyters, which are wanting in many places, for want of maintenance. Now for thoſe, in whom autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lyes to take care for the edification of the Church: To diſpoſe the Churches Patrimonie, ſo as may be beſt for edification of the Church, appointing it to maintain preachers, not pomp, will be counted neither ſacriledg, nor theft, by rationall and good men. But you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>we rob the Church of her husband too; for though a Church have</hi> 1000 <hi>Presbyters, yet ſhe hath but one husband: ſo that great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Calcedon;</hi>
               </q> but that Counſell ſpake according to the corrupt cuſtomes of thoſe times, not according to the tenure of Scriptures, who make all the Presbyters over-ſeers over their particular flocks, to dwell with them as men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and to take care for them; and that's to be in your
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:43185:56"/>ſence husband, is it not? After you have made the Church a widow without a Biſhop, you add,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>while a widow, ſhe can bring forth nothing but a baſtard brood, conſider that;</hi>
               </q> yes, I ſhall conſider it, but to your ſhame: what if a Church continue, as often it hath, through covetouſneſs and faction, long without a Biſhop, are all the Converts, begotten by the word of truth preach'd by Prebyters, baſtards? nay, what if Churches caſt off Epiſcopacie, are all her Presbyters baſtards? Do you thus gratifie the Papiſts, and abuſe all the Miniſters of our ſiſter reformed Churches? many of which far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip you in all miniſteriall qualification; your aſſertion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is very conſiderable, to diſcover what a Popiſh ſpirit you are of.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Parag.</hi> 20. Whether your concluſion will follow on the premiſes, or mine, I now leave to the judicious Reader. I would not have the King, for fear of the people, to do any unlawfull act: I diſclaimed it in the very entrance of my Caſe reſolved; but I only perſwade to what, for ought I yet ſee, I have proved lawfull; and that to reſcue a periſhing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and prevent the hazard of his Crown; which, that it may be free, and flouriſhing on his head, is my daily and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prayer, as thoſe that know me can very well witneſs, notwithſtanding your ignorant calumniations, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
            <div type="resolution">
               <head>Caſe of Conſcience Reſolved.</head>
               <p>MY ſecond Antagoniſt exceeds the firſt, both in ſubtiltie and peremptorineſs; for he plainly affirms, that the King cannot deſert Epiſcopacie, without flat perjurie; and hence falls foul, both on thoſe that would force him to it: and alſo on thoſe moderate Courtiers, that for peace ſake, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell'd it. He diſputes thus; There's difference between laws and oaths: Where the ſupream <hi>Jus dominii</hi> is, there is a power above all laws, but not above their own oaths, in whom that power is; for law bindes only while it is a law, that is, till it be repealed: But an oath bindeth as long as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, to whom it is taken: The reaſon is, becauſe the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43185:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſupream power may <hi>cedere jure ſuo,</hi> and obliege himſelf where before he was free; which if they do by promiſe, juſtice bindes them to performance; but if by an oath, (the matter being lawful) then are they bound in religion and conſcience; for an oath adds a religious bond unto God. If this were not ſo, no oath were binding to them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; Firſt, its a ground laid down by this Author in the ſame place, that no oath is obligatorie beyond the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and then I firſt propound it to conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intention of this oath be not only againſt a tyrannous invaſion on the rights of the Clergie, not againſt an orderly alteration of them, if any prove inconvenient; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them againſt violence, not againſt legal waies of change?</p>
               <p>For firſt, this is as much, as is rationall for a King to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake; and therfore in right reaſon, the oath ſhould have no other ſenſe, if the words of the oath will bear it, as the words of this oath will.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this oath to the Clergie, muſt not be intended in a ſenſe inconſiſtent with the Kings oath, to the people, firſt taken for their protection in their laws and liberties; for then the latter oath will be a preſent breach of the former, and ſo unlawfull. Now one of the Priviledges of the People is, that the Peers and Commons in Parliament, have power, with the conſent of the King, to alter whatever, in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſtate, is inconvenient to the whole. And therefore he cannot afterward engage himſelf to any particular eſtate, to exempt it from this power; for by that oath, at leaſt, <hi>ceſſit jure ſuo,</hi> in this Authors judgment; The Clergie and their priviledges, are ſubject to the Parliament, or they are not; I hope, they will not now claim an exemption from fecular power: But if they be under Parliamentarie power, how can it be rationally conceived to be the meaning of the Kings oath, to preſerve the Priviledges of the Clergie againſt that power, to which they are legally ſubject? or how were the oath in that ſenſe, conſiſtent with the priviledges of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, formerly ſworn to by the king? If the oath had ſuch a ſence in times of Poperie, when the Clergie were a diſtinct Corporation; yet when that exemption was aboliſh'd, as a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43185:57"/>branch of Anti-Chriſtian uſurpation: The change of their condition muſt needs change the intention of the oath, unleſs they will ſay, that the Crown ſtands ſtill engaged to them, to maintain ſuch priviledges as by Act of Parliament, were long ſince aboliſh'd, which is, to make his oath to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant to that taken before, for the maintenance of the laws: Its apparent then, to make the intention of the oath to be againſt a legal alteration by Parliament, makes it unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo not obligatorie. And if it be not intended againſt legall alteration, the king may paſs a Bill for the abolition of Epiſcopacie, when his Houſes of Parliament think it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and petition for it, without violation of his oath.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. PARAG. 1. <hi>Wherein is ſhewed, what the true intention of the Kings oath is, for maintenance of Epiſcopacie, in anſwer to Doctor</hi> Boughen's 8. <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Come now to anſwer the 8. Chapter, wherein you were pleaſed to take in hand this paſſage, beginning with my anſwer to my latter opponent, firſt; and yet you did not make an end with him, before you undertook to reply to my anſwer to my firſt opponent; which how judicious it is, let the Reader judge: for what advantage you did it, you beſt know.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is, you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Whether the King may deſert Epiſcopacie without perjury,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>a queſtion too high for any ſubject;</hi> but you <hi>are enforced to make that a queſtion, that is <q rend="margQuotes">harſh to loyal ears, leſt you may ſeem to avoid my ſubtile and ſaucie cavils, as unanſwerable</q>.</hi> Good words, Doctor: If the queſtion be too high for a ſubject, have not I the ſame plea for medling with it, that you have, being led into it by my opponents? but the truth is, the queſtion is fit enough for diſcuſſion, ſo it be done with reverence; whatever I am, I know you will confeſs, that both my former opponents
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43185:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>knew as well their dutie to our Soveraign, as you your ſelf, and were as obſervant of it: when men are to act by counſel or prayer for kings, unleſs they know, in Caſes propoſed, what is conſcionable for him to do, or not to do, how can they rightly perform their duties? To balk ſuch queſtions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on juſt occaſion, is not dutie, but flatterie; and to leave kings and their Counſellors without needfull light: But you have a quarrell to me, for ſaying
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>my ſecond Antagoniſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that the King cannot deſert Epiſcopacie without flat perjury, and ſay, his words are far more mannerly;</hi>
                  </q> why did you not then ſet down his more mannerly words, but abuſe your reader with a falſitie? but you will prove the thing,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>that Epiſcopacie may not be deſerted without violation of oath, and the Church left to ſwine.</hi>
                  </q> No Sir, we would purge it of ſwine, and doggs too, which they expoſed its choiceſt outward priviledges to; but how do you prove it?</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Parag.</hi> 2. You go a begging,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>telling one of my confeſſion,</hi>
                  </q> when I do but take the words of the oath from my Antagoniſts mouth, and diſpute <hi>ex conceſſo,</hi> that the oath is as he relates it, To protect the Biſhops, &amp;c, and then you bring your obſervations,
<q rend="margQuotes">1. <hi>Good Kings protect Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> 2. <hi>They ought to do it.</hi> 3. <hi>In right they ought to do it.</hi>
                  </q> But when I confeſs, that theſe words are in the oath, muſt I therefore approve all that is in the oath, yea, and take them in your ſenſe too? I hope not.</p>
               <p>Thus far I approve the kings protecting Biſhops, within the limits of their calling ſet them of God; but our Prelates have excluded their fellow-Presbyters. But thirdly, as <hi>of right he ought to do;</hi> I take to be a limitation how far he engageth himſelf, that is, ſo far as a good king in right ought to do, and if he go no further, he is injurious to none, though he diſpleaſes many, as you ſay, <hi>Parag.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 4. You add,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>the King hath ſworn to be protector of the Church under his government, but that cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he protect the Biſhops, who are the Miniſterial ſpouſe of the Church:</hi>
                  </q> This is a falſe inference, for though the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie be neceſſarie to the Church, yet not your Prelacie, which is but an humane additament: your proof is preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43185:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>to make any man a Miniſteriall ſpouſe of the Church, as well as it is for the Pope to be made a Miniſterial head of it.</p>
               <p>Yet you repeat it, <hi>Parag.</hi> 5. With our frequent diſh of <hi>no ordination without them,</hi> which hath been often enough an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. You conclude,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>if Biſhops be of the ſame order with the Apoſtles, you have</hi> Calvins <hi>acknowledgment, that the Church cannot ſtand without them:</hi>
                  </q> yea, and mine too, and yet never the nearer; for, <hi>Ante Leves ergo.</hi> &amp;c. as ſoon ſhall you finde Harts feeding in the middle region of the air, as your Biſhops among the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>You add, <hi>Parag.</hi> 6.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>that the Church cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Biſhop, if we believe</hi> Cyprian, <hi>that the Biſhop is in the Church, and the Church in the Biſhop;</hi> you add, <hi>that the Church is in the Biſhop, cauſally,</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c. If you underſtand by the Biſhop, the Miniſterie, and by cauſally, as an inſtrument of its preſervation; I grant it, without any inconvenience: otherwaies we can grant the Church to be cauſally in none other but Jeſus Chriſt, the true head of it; nor is there any other that is fountain of it: its as flat Poperie to judg other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, as to make the Pope the head of the Church: nay worſe: For <hi>Hart</hi> makes the Pope to be the head; not as the fountain of life, as your ſimilitude imports: but only in regard of directing the outward functions; and yet for this, that mirror of learning, Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> doth implead Mr. <hi>Hart</hi> of high treaſon againſt Chriſt. And I remember alſo there, a witty and rationall anſwer, that our learned Doctor makes to a place cited out of <hi>Leo. He grants Leo was an ancient: learned, holy, and witty man, yet a man, and a Biſhop of</hi> Rome, &amp;c. <hi>and applies to him a ſaying of</hi> Tully <hi>to</hi> Hortenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, <hi>when he immoderately praiſed eloquence, that he would lift her up to heaven, that himſelf might go up with her; ſo did</hi> Leo <hi>lift up St.</hi> Peter, &amp;c. So <hi>Cyprian</hi> was an holy man, but a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, ſo he might extoll Biſhops, that he might lift up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them. See confer, between <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Hart. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>diviſ.</hi> 2. therefore your premiſſes have not yet force to draw my conſent to their concluſion.</p>
               <p>Parag. 7. You grant, <hi>"that the oath is not obligatory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:43185:58"/>the intention,</hi> that is, ſay you,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>according to the common plain and literall meaning of it;</hi>
                  </q> good: as the plain literall meaning is to be found out of the grammar of it: and other circumſtances, that may convince Reaſon of the intention of it.</p>
               <p>You add, <hi>Parag.</hi> 8.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>That the oath is to the Clergie, The King muſt have reſpect to them and their intention.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, not mentall, but what the words of the oath import, conſidered with its circumſtances; nor ſo much to the intention of the now giver, as the firſt framer.</p>
               <p>Now, I beſeech you, if the King ſhould have ask'd the Biſhops, at the giving, whether if a Caſe ſhould fall out, that he muſt not only venture (which he hath done,) but loſe his Crown, rather then fail to ſave them, whether they would have ſaid, yea, that is the meaning: Truly I believe not, and if they had, the King and Peers, and people, would have hiſſ'd them out rather, then the one would have perſwaded, or the other would have yielded to have taken it with that ſenſe and intention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 9. You enquire,,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>whether what hath been done, hath not been a tyrannous invaſion?</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, there hath been too much tumult, and Miniſters have ſuffered too irregularly on both ſides; but when the Houſes preſent a Petition to the king, with a Bill, for aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Epiſcopacie, that only is the regular way, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the king not to be ingaged againſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 10. You ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>it was his duty to protect you while it was in his power.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, it was, and is his dutie, ſo far as it was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the oath, but was not to hazard the deſtruction of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and kingdom, for your Prelates; yet I adviſe not the breaking of his oath, as you would hint; but I limit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the engagement of the oath, as in reaſon it ought to be. <hi>If you be not againſt an orderly alteration,</hi> (as you ſay, Parag. 4.) You grant the queſtion, for then if the Parliament lay down their ſwords, and come with a Petition to deſire his aſſent, notwithſtanding his oath, he may aſſent, which was the thing to be proved.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43185:59"/>
               <p>For my part, I abhor force upon a king; but if he might ſign a Bill without force, I ſee no reaſon why danger of force can make it unlawfull.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Parag.</hi> 12. I ſay, if the king hath done his beſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them againſt violence, they can require no more, he hath done as much as his oath doth require; now he may take care to preſerve himſelf, iſſue, and people. And for his Miniſters, let them anſwer for themſelves.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Proceed now to anſwer your eight Chapter, whoſe very Title is ominious,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Whether the Kings Oath taken to the Clergie, be injurious to his other ſubjects, and inconſiſtent with his oath to his people.</hi>
                  </q> Hereby you would inſinuate, that I affirm it is, whereas I affirm, it cannot be conceived ſo to be, and therefore we muſt not put a ſence upon it to make it ſo to be; and from this ground, I impugne your falſe ſence of the oath, namely, that it takes away all power from the King, at the ſuit of his Parliament, to alter any of their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, whereof they ſhew the grievance.

                  </q> Not I Sir, but when King and Parliament have made them, they have propriety in them. The priviledg of them is uſually called part of their birth-right. A man may call an houſe his own, becauſe he poſſeſſeth it, and hath the benefit of it, though he made it not. So I call the laws the peoples: But yet the following cavil is worſe: For whereas I ſay, one of the priviledges of the people is, that the Peers, and Commons in Parliament, have power, with conſent of the King, to alter what ever, in any eſtate, is prejudicial to the whole; <hi>I had thought</hi> (ſay <q rend="margQuotes">you) <hi>this had not been a priviledg of the people, but the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Repreſenters, not the people Repreſentees, &amp;c.</hi>

'<hi>First, the curſe for ſacriledg;</hi> but I have freed the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intended from guilt of ſacriledg, and therefore that is the curſe cauſeleſs, that ſhall not come: If no more be done, then by my caſe, I prove lawful.

And have we not had many ſuch, under the Biſhops, in their, and other Lay-impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Nay, was it not a deſign to fill all the Pariſhes in the Epiſcopal Cities, with the Singing-men of the Cathedral? Which was in a great part effected: and were not they of the loweſt, and many times of the worſt condition of the people? This is like to continue, and increaſe, if the Church be farther ſpoiled. But if the Biſhops, and Deans and Chapters lands be imploied to maintain Parochial Paſtors; this will help to fill the Church with able and learned Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and encourage men to dedicate their Children to the Miniſtery, and them to imbrace it: becauſe if they be learned and unblameable, there will be more opportunitie of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, though not of ſo great promotion, which was compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible but to a few.</p>

For there I ſee, that the King had particularly, and diſtinctly, engaged himſelf to the whole Realm, before he came to the Biſhops, which are the onely part of the Clergie, about whom our controverſie is; and what he laſt promiſes to them, confirmed by his oath, muſt not contradict what he hath promiſed to the other: which promiſe muſt be underſtood to have a prioritie in order, in the bond of the oath, as well as in the bond of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>Parag. 19.
<q rend="margQuotes">You ſpeak <hi>of ſending us to Magna Charta, to know who the People and Commons of this Kingdom are,</hi> &amp;c.</q> whith only fills up ſo much paper, being nothing to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand.</p>
               <p>But Parag. 20.
<q rend="margQuotes">You <hi>reckon up the Priviledges of the Church, as you have gleaned them out of Magna Charta, and Sir</hi> Edward Cook, <hi>in number</hi> 8. <hi>The ſecond is, that no Eccleſiaſticall perſon be amerced according to the value of his Eccleſiaſticall benefice, but according to his lay-tenement, and according to the quality of his offence.</hi>
                  </q> The latter clauſe is reaſon, the former a priviledg without reaſon, and prejudiciall to the Civill ſtate, and gives many Eccleſiaſtical perſons leave to ſin <hi>impunè.</hi> The fourth,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>That all Eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhall enjoy all their lawfull juriſdictions, and other rights,</hi>

                  <hi>wholly without any diminution, or ſubſtraction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi> I pray you, if the Kings Coronation-oath engage ſo to the confirmation of this priviledg, that the king cannot conſent to allow it by Act of Parliament; how can that act be juſtified, that enables the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to appoint
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43185:61"/>what perſons elſe they will, to execute all Eccleſiaſticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction in this kingdom?

               <p>The fifth priviledg you name, is,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>that a Biſhop is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Kings immediate Officer to the Kings Court of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall.</hi>
                  </q> Whence I gather, that by our law, a Biſhop is a kings creature, no Apoſtle; for he was the immediate Officer of Chriſt; though ſubject, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering, to the Civill Magiſtrate, though heathen.</p>
               <p>You conclude,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>that it is provided by act of Parliament, that if any judgment be given, contrary to any points in the great Charter, it ſhall be holden for nought,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>True, unleſs it be upon ſome particular ſtatute of a latter Parliament, with the king, enacting things to the contrarie.</p>

                     <hi>that I go forward, as if it were certain, that this to the Clergie, was a ſeverall oath from that to the people.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. PARAG. 3. <hi>Shewing, that the Clergie are equally under the Parliament, as well as Laytie, in anſwer to Doctor</hi> Boughen's 9. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Now come to anſwer your ninth Chapter, which is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie one; which makes me think that you were ſorely puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: My <hi>Dilemma</hi> is, They are ſubject to the Parliament, or they are not. He anſwers,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>ſubject they are to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſting of head and members; not to the members alone, without the head; for we are ſubject to the members, only for the heads ſake.</hi>
                  </q> Truly, this grant is all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or need; for the Parliament, I propoſe the <hi>Dilemma</hi> about, is that which conſiſts of head and members united; to which if they be ſubject, then may theſe joyntly determine of any of their priviledges, in their own nature alterable, as they do of thoſe of the people. Indeed, the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought not to take away any priviledges that are for edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but ſuch as prove impediments rather; but, of that they are to be Judges, in the application of their power, and that's all needfull to be ſaid to parag. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>And yet I leave it with confidence to the judicious Reader, as alſo, what I have ſaid in the former <hi>Paragraph,</hi> touching a former and latter oath.</p>
               <p>But whereas you ask, Parag. 6.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>with what face I can ſay, that the Kings oath to the Clergie is inconſiſtent with his oath to the people,</hi> parag. 6.</q> I wonder with what face you can aver it, when as I directly ſay, it muſt not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take off an interpretation of it, that would make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent: whereas you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>the nation is weary of the Presbyterian government in three years;</hi>
                  </q> its but a piece of none-ſence, ſith this three years, (except a little liveleſs ſhew in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and ſome few places more) the truth is, and our miſerie is, that we have been under no Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43185:62"/>government at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 7. You mention my words,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>if the oath had ſuch a ſence when the Clergie were a diſtinct Corporation, on which you ſpend your judgment, if you know what ſence is.</hi>
                  </q> Truly Sir, you are the worſt at picking out ſence, that ever I knew, of a D. D. My meaning is plain, if the oath had a ſence to exempt them from power of Parliament, it muſt be when they were a diſtinct Corporation, under another Supremacie, which now you diſclaim.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parag.</hi> 8. You miſtake, "<hi>in ſaying I am zealous in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing you and your Priviledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer to the diſtinction brought by my opponent, that it is not ſuch, but that the Priviledges of Clergie and People (I mean ſuch as are alterable) are equally under Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentarie power, for alteration on juſt grounds. And the kings oath to you is as obligatorie, as to the people, in the right ſence, and intention of it, which the review of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant ſaith, is all the obligation of an oath.</p>
               <p>Parag. 9. You ſpeak about <hi>the change of the condition of the "Clergie, as though the intent were to make it ſlavery.</hi> Sure Sir, its far from my intent: The Engliſh Laytie are not ſlaves. He that ſaith, the Priviledges of the Engliſh Clergie, that they hold by law, are inviolable to them, while the law remains; but that the laws concerning them, are alterable; makes them not ſlaves, but equall in freedom to any Engliſh Lay-ſubject.</p>
               <p>But Parag. 10. You would pretend to a little ſubtiltie; for you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>the change of the Clergies condition, from Popery to Proteſtancy, was for the better or for the worſe.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, undoubtedly, for better, morally; for now we are in Chriſts way. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Then we were in Anti-Chriſts way but yet in a civill reſpect, we have not ſuch exemptions or liberties as we had: we are more under uncivil power, but this is for the better; for that libertie that is without Gods leave, is not indeed a priviledg, but a ſnare to the partie holding it. I confeſs with you,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>that the intent of the Kings oath, was to protect his ſubjects in their ſeverall places, dignities, and degrees, and not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43185:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>them to oppreſs one another;</hi>
                  </q> but not to deny any Bill, that upon adviſement, ſhall be preſented, and manifeſted to conduce to the weal publique.</p>
               <p>You proceed, Parag. 11.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>The intention of the oath, is to maintain the ancient, legall, and the juſt rights of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I have anſwered, it is to maintain them againſt illegall oppreſſion, but not againſt legall alteration, that you ſhould prove, but do not. The continual practice of the nation is with me, wherein by divers ſtatutes, many Canonical Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges have been altered, as 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. all Canonicall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, contrariant to the Kings Prerogative, and civil laws, and 1 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in giving power to the Crown to exerciſe all Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, by whom ſhe will appoint; and this is all that I affirm, that Priviledges are alterable by an orderly way in Parliament, and therefore <hi>you may take the Ghoſtly Fathers place to the man of ſin,</hi> which you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath to me; you are fitter to ſerve the Pope then I; you hold, <hi>no Biſhop, no Church:</hi> but ſuch paſſions I look at, but as winchings when an argument pincheth.</p>
               <p>For Parag. 12. I conſent to Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>of the Kings engagement, to maintain the rights and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Church;</hi> nor is he againſt my limitation, for its known what his opinion was, of the power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; That they might alter what ever they ſaw inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to publikeweal.</p>
               <p>In your parag. 12. You wilfully ſlander me, <hi>that I would "perſwade the Laytie, that the Clergies weal is their woe.</hi> I only affirm, that if all ſuch Priviledges of the Clergie, that are in their nature alterable, be made unalterable by the kings oath; (that let the kingdom ſink or ſwim, the King cannot conſent by Act of Parliament, to alter them,) then are they inconſiſtent with the people; and this I ſay again. And I am carried thereto, by evidence of truth, and not any <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus appetitus</hi> after wealth and honour. Thoſe that know me, will but laugh at your raſhneſs, in theſe miſtaken calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>The former part of your 14. Parag. is paſſionate non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43185:63"/>the latter part is a contradiction; for you ſay,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>if this oath be not againſt legall alteration, in the true and literal ſenſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King may not, without violation of his oath, paſs a Bill for the abolition of Epiſcopacie.</hi>
                  </q> What (I pray you) is legall alteration, of any thing here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but alteration by conſent of the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? How can this oath then, if it be not againſt a legall alteration, be againſt an alteration by Bill in Parliament? which is the only legall alteration of Priviledges, founded on law in <hi>England;</hi> you are the ſtrangeſt opponent that ever I met with, you make nothing of giving the cauſe, and rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at me for carrying it.</p>
               <p>To as little purpoſe is all you conclude with, parag. 15. Whereas I ſay, he may paſs a Bill; <hi>you wonder, I ſay not, he</hi>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>muſt paſs a Bill;</hi> you add, <hi>I ſay that which is equivalent. He cannot now deny conſent without ſin;</hi>
                  </q> but yet Sir, this muſt ariſe, not from any authoritie of the Houſes, but from the condition of the King, to preſerve, or reſtore peace to his kingdoms: For the kings negative voice, I alwaies aſſerted it, as well as you, both in word and writing; but I affirm, he hath power of an affirmative voice, to confirm any thing that is for good of his people, which he hath not, nor ought not to ſwear away.</p>
               <p>It may be, you will ſay, true, if abolition of Epiſcopacie were for the good of the nation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that's to paſs to another queſtion, and to grant this in hand; but beſides, the King and Parliament are to judg of the goodneſs of it, for the nation; and if they erre, they are anſwerable to God alone.</p>

               <head>Caſe of Conſcience reſolved.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, I anſwer, from the expreſſions of the oath it ſelf, as they are ſet down by the ſame Author, pag. 74. To protect the Biſhops and their Priviledges, to his power, as every good king in his kingdom, ought to protect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Biſhops, and Churches, under their government.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee, the engagement of the king, is but to his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43185:63"/>as every good King ought in right to protect, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now ſuch power is no further then he can do it, without ſinning againſt God, and being injurious to the reſt of his people. When then he hath interpoſed his authoritie for them, and put forth all the power he hath to preſerve them; if after all this, he muſt let them fall, or ſupport them with the bloud of his good ſubjects, and thoſe unwilling too, to engage their lives for the others priviledges; I think none need queſtion, but that he hath gone to the extent of his power, and as far as good Kings are bound in right; for it is not equall, to engage the lives of ſome, to uphold the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of others. That were to be cruel to many thouſands, to be indulgent to a few. Suppoſe a king put a Commander into a City, and give him an oath, to maintain the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it, and keep it for him to his power; and this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander keeps this town till he hath no more ſtrength to hold it, unleſs he force the Towneſ-men to arms, againſt that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which he hath ſworn to maintain. If this Governor now ſurrender this town upon compoſition, doth he violate his oath? I think, none will affirm it: Such is the caſe with the king in this particular: when he hath gone as far in their protection, as is conſiſtent with the weal of other his liege people, which he is ſworn to tender; he hath protected them to his power, and his obligation is no further by the words of the oath.</p>
               <p>The only objection, as I conceive, which lyeth againſt this, is, that though it be not in the Kings power to uphold them, yet it is in his power, not to conſent to their fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the king ſhould be peremptorie in denyal, what help would this be to them? Such peremptorineſs in this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, might indanger his Crown, not ſave their Miters. Beſides, though it be in his power to deny aſſent to their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, in a natural ſence, becauſe <hi>voluntas non poteſt cogi;</hi> yet is it not in his power in a morall ſence, becauſe he cannot now deny conſent, without ſin; for if he conſent not, there will evidently continue ſuch diſtraction, and confuſion, as is moſt repugnant to the weal of his people, which he is bound, by the rule of government, and his oath, to provide for.</p>

               </q> But this is but to ſhuffle, and alters the ſtate of a queſtion, to elude the force of an Argument, which you cannot anſwer: That which I ſaid, was, it was not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual for the King to engage, by his command, the lives of ſome, to maintain the priviledges of others, which I ſpake upon this ſuppoſition; That if the King had condeſcended in point of Epiſcopacie, the War would have been at an end, Laws reſtored to exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For both City, and the Scotiſh Nation, would have cloſed with him: and for this cauſe alone, <hi>viz.</hi> to maintain power of Biſhops, I ſay, it would not have been equal to have engaged the lives of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; nor were they willing, as I have been informed, Nobles, nor others. It may be, the King thought condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this, would not have ſet him and his people, in quiet poſſeſſion of their rights; but I cannot but wiſh, that it had been tryed, that nothing lawful had been omitted, by which there was any hope to have ſaved a great deal of miſery, that his Majeſtie, his Royal relations, and the whole Nation hath ſuffered.</p>

               </q> But truely I muſt tell you, that the people reaped but little in ſpirituals from many of the Biſhops, who ſeldom preached themſelves, and rob'd many people of their ſpirituals, by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing their Miniſters; and though there were no Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> the people may reap ſpiritual things from the Clergie, as plentifully, if not more, then ever they did; as well as without them, they do in other reformed Churches.

               <p>THirdly, I anſwer, that this Opponent in this Diſpute, argues upon this ground, that the ſupream <hi>jus Dominij,</hi> even that which is above all laws, is in the King: which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour, I conceive, in our State is a manifeſt Error. There's a ſupremacie in the King, and a ſupremacie in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. But the ſupremacie, or the <hi>ſupremum jus Dominij,</hi> which is over all laws <hi>figere, &amp; refigere,</hi> to make or diſanul them at pleaſure, is neither in the King, nor in the Houſes apart, but in both conjoyn'd. The King is the ſupream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, from whom all power of execution of laws is legally derived. The Parliament is the ſupream Court, by which all other Courts, which derive their power for execution of laws from the King by his Commiſſioners, are to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the King and the Parliament are the ſupream power to make and diſanul laws. Sith then this <hi>ſupremum jus Dominij,</hi> that is over all laws, is not in the King: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lawfully make any engagement to any againſt the laws, and legal rites of others; for that were not <hi>cedere jure ſuo, ſed alieno.</hi> This oath then to the Clergie cannot engage him againſt the legal priviledges of the people, or the Parliament, which he is bound to maintain; one of which is, to be readie, by confirming needful Bills, to relieve them, from whatſoever grievance they ſuffer from any. And thus, I think, the Caſe is ſufficiently cleared, that notwithſtanding the Kings oath to the Clergie at his Coronation, he may conſent to the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Prelacie out of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>and wiſedom of their Ancestors, hath ſo moulded our government, out of a mixture of all the three,</hi> viz. <hi>abſolute Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and Democracy, as to give to this Kingdom, as far as humane providence can provide the conveniences of all three, without the inconveniences of any one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then a little after. In this Kingdom, the laws are joyntly made by a King, by an Houſe of Peers, and by an Houſe of Commons, choſen by the people, all having free votes and particular priviledges. The government, according to theſe laws, is truſted to the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Have not I now followed my copy right? the ſupream power to make laws, is Ariſtocrati, cal in three States, free to vote, and the King the ſupream Magiſtrate to execute laws. One would think, if this would not make you bluſh for what is paſt, yet it may ſtop your mouth for future; and I need not ſay no more on this point; yet I will give a little touch to ſhew the vanitie of your flouriſhes.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Parag.</hi> 4. Is a meer flaſh, <hi>attended with the ſparkles of light calumnies;</hi> For I have not made one of two, I yet leave one abſolute Supaemacie, as you confeſs in the next <hi>parag. the Supremacie to make and unmake laws.</hi> This is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in King, nor Houſes apart, but conjoyned.</p>
            <p>Here then we are fallen back to one Supremacie. Why did you then trifle ſo much about two? But this (ſay you) is to skip from <hi>Monarchie</hi> to <hi>Ariſtocracie;</hi> juſt as his Majeſtie hath told you, in this government there's a mixture; its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocratical <hi>in Legis lation,</hi> Monarchical for execution; and therein is the excellency of it; the one being fitteſt for Law-making by ſolidity; the other for execution by cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie; and yet this D.D. jeers, as though this was never ſeen before, becauſe he wanted eyes: But now comes a precious one. He believes it well appears,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>That ſupremacie over all Laws, to make or diſanul them, is in the King alone, at the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of both Houſes.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Ridiculum caput;</hi> for its as much as to ſay, its in the King alone with the help of others; a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Bull. That power is in a man alone which he can execute without the concurrence of others; but this the King cannot do, without the Houſes manifeſting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43185:70"/>and deſire by Petition. Beſides, have you forgot the ſtatute, your ſelf quoted, <hi>pag.</hi> 85?
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>That no Act of Par lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be paſſed by any Sovereign of this Realm, or any other authority whatſoever, without the advice and conſent of the three Eſtates of the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>Oportet te eſſe memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will come to <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, and moderne Authors,</hi> as <hi>Parag.</hi> 6. 'Peter <hi>aſcribeth ſupremacie to the King,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. But that is clearly, as I have ſaid, as Supream Magiſtrate, to whom others are ſubordinate, and this admonition muſt be with limitation too, where Kings are ſupream. You do not think that the Apoſtle doth level all Kings, and give them all one equal ſupremacie; No, the Apoſtle had no power, nor would not attempt, to alter the conſtitution of Nations. Now <hi>Grotius</hi> will tell you; ſome Kings are not ſupream. Thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> were under the power of the people, thoſe of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> under the <hi>Ephori.</hi> See <hi>Grot. de jure bel. &amp; pac. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>parag.</hi> 8. The ſentences out of Fathers, which you quote, <hi>parag.</hi> 6, and 7. ſpeak of abſolute Monarchs, which you ignorantly, or flatteringly, ſay ours is; but our King denies it, calling our government, a mixture of all the three, and a regular Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, Collect. of Declar. <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 320. 321. And that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence cited by you out of <hi>Grotius</hi> will confute you;
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>Thats the ſupream civil power, cujus actus alterius juri non ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Whoſe acts are not ſubject to another mans cenſure;</hi> For thoſe acts that any do by the Kings authoritie, are the Kings acts; and the Parliament hath power to diſanul theſe acts, and puniſh <hi>theſe agents,</hi> as the King informeth, <hi>Collect.</hi> of <hi>Remonſtr.</hi> pag. 321. to ſhew, the compleatneſs of our government. <hi>Our Law indeed</hi> (ſaith the king) <hi>can do no wrong;</hi> that is, he cannot work, but by Agents: and the law takes no notice of him in it, but of the Agents, to puniſh them.</p>
            <p>But you proceed, <hi>Parag.</hi> 8. <hi>I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ow</hi> (ſay you)
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>you relye more upon the laws of the Land then upon the Word of God.</hi>
               </q> But I believe therein you ſpeak againſt your conſcience; what you produce, that the king is the ſupream Head, is no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43185:71"/>more then what I aſcribe to him, to be ſupream Magiſtrate, and in that he is alone, and the head one; and therefore the <hi>Bull</hi> of two Supremacies, you ſpeak of, is but a <hi>Calf</hi> of your own fancie.</p>
            <p>What you ſay, <hi>Parag.</hi> 9, 10. 13. <hi>Touching the Parliament</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>being ſubjects, and petitioning to him as ſubjects, and that Bills are not in force without him.</hi>
               </q> I confeſs: but theſe onely denie that ſupremacie in the Parlament, which I never aſſerted: but do not aſſert the ſupremacy in the king, to make, or un-make laws, without them. Therefore all this is trifling.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Par.</hi> 11. You ask,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>What ſupremacie can be in that Court, that cannot lawfully Convene, till the King ſummonthem?</hi>
               </q> There is this; The ſupremacie of a Court, as you confeſs, to be the ſupream Court; that is, there is no appeal from them, but appeals from all Courts to them: and you know, they can reverſe decrees in Courts, which the King cannot; he can pardon, not reverſe ſentences. They can reverſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts but not pardon offenders.</p>
            <p>You add <hi>Parag.</hi> 12.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>The King is to regulate them for the time.</hi>
               </q> I acknowledg it: this Parliament onely excepted, by a particular Statute, made in this Parliament with the Kings aſſent. And for the manner, The king himſelf ſaith, they are free, and have priviledges of their own. <hi>For the great Lawyers judgement,</hi> you ſpeak of, in <hi>Richard</hi> the 2.
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>time, That if any in Parliament proceed upon other Articles, or in other manner then is limited by the King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they are to be puniſhed as Traytors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I wonder, you will mention it, ſith that great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer was flattering <hi>Treſilyan,</hi> who by ſuch ill Counſel helpt to over-throw his Sovereign: and in a Parliament, held in the 13, year of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. was for this, by the Lords in Parliament, condemned to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, which was preſently executed on him, as our Hiſtorians ſhew.</p>
            <p>Your Collections, <hi>Par.</hi> 14. were diſproved before: what you ſay '<hi>for the Kings regulating Courts of justice.</hi> You miſtake, the Law is their rule, and that regulates them, which if they
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:43185:71"/>transgreſs, he may puniſh them: but the law they are ſworn to follow, againſt any private inſtructions of his; thats clearly known.</p>
            <p>You ſum up <hi>your arguments, Parag.</hi> 15. But they are all ſhort of your concluſion: for they conclude not againſt the Parliaments being a ſupream Court, which is all I aſſert, and you confeſs in the following <hi>page:</hi> Nay, in this <hi>page, parag.</hi> 17. and what you have, <hi>parag.</hi> 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. Are ſuperfluous: For they onely concludet he King to be ſupream Magiſtrate, but exclude not the Parliament from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupream Court: you ſay, <hi>but yet it is the Kings Court.</hi> I deny it not; I denie him onely to be above it, in the capacitie of a Court, though it ſit by his writ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all you do here, is, but <hi>lis de lana caprina,</hi> meer trifling.</p>
            <p>And as captious a conceipt is that, that you conceive not
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>They have power to make and alter laws at pleaſure; for there is great danger in altering laws without urgent cauſe.</hi>
               </q> Who doubts it? What need you prove it? But to make up want of proof in things to be proved? Who knows not, that wiſedom and moderation in Law makers, is to regulate that power that they may put forth upon any, that they put it not forth, but upon juſt occaſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parag.</hi> 22. You infer,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>If the King cannot do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the legal rights of others, ſo nor Parliaments.</hi>
               </q> True; they ought not to over-rule or alter the rights of other, but for the publike good; but for that they may; you know there were many had legal rights in offices in Star-Chamber, and yet for publike good, the King condeſcended to a Bill of abrogation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parag.</hi> 23. You tell us, '<hi>The King is above law.</hi> That is, ſay you, <hi>Common-law.</hi> But this is your fiction; for the King ſaith, he is a regular Monarch, that is regulated by laws, ſo in a ſence, under them. The common cuſtom of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that actions may be commenced againſt the King at the Common-law; therefore you ſpeak againſt experience, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the king is above the Common-law; which appears alſo, in that the Judges of the Common, as well as Statute-law, are ſworn not to denie, or delay juſtice to any, for any
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43185:72"/>Letter, or Prohibition of the king.
<q rend="margQuotes">And though his <hi>taking the Parliament into the joynt aſſiſtance of making laws, makes not them ſupream:</hi>
               </q> yet it hinders that ſupremacie of laws-making from being ſolely in him, ſith he can do nothing without them.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Parag.</hi> 24. <hi>I would not brand you, nor delude the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as you object; But onely ſeek to give a rational ſence of the kings oath, which they that oppoſe, brand themſelves. I did believe, what I expres'd in my good conceit of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Biſhops tenderneſs to preſerve the King from hazzard; but if they be all of your minde, I ſee I am deceived for; let the Crown, or life of king, ſink or ſwim, he ſhall have no conſent from you to enlarge his conſcience, to conſent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh Epiſcopacie, for the ſafegard of either.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Parag.</hi> 25. 26. I deſire no more, then that the king ſhould give every one his own, preferring the publike before any private. I confeſs the kings readineſs to confirm Bills, ſuch and ſo large, as never were the like; but yet I know, and you know, what danger the king and land hath been, and is in, for want of conſent to let down Epiſcopacie: And in this exigent wherein we are, by the corruption of man, I humbly give my advice, to promote Peace, and prevent much of that blood, and miſery, which for want of peace ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues; and threatens worſe to the Church (I confeſs) then either the want or preſence of Biſhops.</p>
            <p>But your Sun muſt ſet under a Cloud, and therefore, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag.</hi> 17. you tell me,
<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>He that ſlayeth a Prelate, to whom he owes faith and obedience, its Treaſon:</hi> you amplifie, <hi>If it be Treaſon to kill a Prelate, then how much greater to kill Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Negatur Argumentum, egregie</hi> D. D. It follows not; for he that kills a Biſhop, kills a man, and he hath Gods Image ſtampt on him. But Epiſcopacy, as I have ſhewed, is but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>an inhumane creature;</hi> ſo he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved regularly, without any injury to God. Beſides, you conſider not that <hi>Biſhop</hi> is a concrete word, including a man and Epiſcopacy, <hi>Concretum relativum,</hi> as the Logicians call it. But Epiſcopacie is an abſtract: your ſimilitude onely holds thus, <hi>as it were worſe to kill the ſpecies, then one man; ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43185:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>to aboliſh Epiſcopacy, then to degrade one Biſhop;</hi> If either were evil. But, in a regular way, I have ſhewed you, both are good; therefore, as I fear not your law, ſo I doubt not of Gods approbation, being conſcious to my ſincere intentions, for the good of King and kingdom, in it.</p>
            <p>For your Concluſion, <hi>Parag. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lt.</hi> I muſt minde you, that it cannot be better then the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<q rend="margQuotes">
                  <hi>That would the abolition of Epiſcopacy make our peace, put an end to blood, rapine, miſery:</hi>
               </q> The king may with ſafety and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation do it. But if God be not pleaſed to perſwade his heart ſo far; If that moderation that he would bring them to, would ſatisfie others: I think, as the caſe ſtands, they may do innocently, and commendably, to cloſe with him. Yea, I think, thoſe, who upon a ſerious conſideration of the over-flowing of all ſin, with an high hand, ſhall yield firſt; (that ſome government may be ſetled in the Church, Laws recover their power in the Common-wealth, ſin be prevented, Juſtice and amity revived) they will be moſt acceptable to God, and ought to be ſo with men.</p>
